Perform the movement by rotating the trunk and hips as you swing the weight all the way down to one side. Keep your arms extended throughout the exercise. Reverse the motion to swing the weight all the way to the opposite side. Continue alternating the movement until the set is complete."
Elbow plank,strength,abdominals,body_only,intermediate,"Get into a prone position on the floor, supporting your weight on your toes and your forearms. Your arms are bent and directly below the shoulder. Keep your body straight at all times, and hold this position as long as possible. To increase difficulty, an arm or leg can be raised."
Bottoms Up,strength,abdominals,body_only,intermediate,"Begin by lying on your back on the ground. Your legs should be straight and your arms at your side. This will be your starting position. To perform the movement, tuck the knees toward your chest by flexing the hips and knees. Following this, extend your legs directly above you so that they are perpendicular to the ground. Rotate and elevate your pelvis to raise your glutes from the floor. After a brief pause, return to the starting position."
Suspended ab fall-out,strength,abdominals,other,intermediate,"Adjust the straps so the handles are at an appropriate height, below waist level. Begin standing and grasping the handles. Lean into the straps, moving to an incline push-up position. This will be your starting position. Keeping your arms straight, lean further into the suspension straps, bringing your body closer to the ground, allowing your shoulders to extend, raising your arms up and over your head. Maintain a neutral spine and keep the rest of your body straight, your shoulders being the only joints allowed to move. Pause during the peak contraction, and then return to the starting position."
Dumbbell V-Sit Cross Jab,strength,abdominals,dumbbell,intermediate,"Begin seated on your butt with your knees bent and feet on the ground. Lean your upper body back to form a 45-degree angle with the floor. Bring your feet off the ground so that your body resembles a ""V"" shape. Grasp a dumbbell in each hand and hold tight to your chest with palms facing each other. This will be your starting position. While keeping your core tight and maintaining your body's ""V"" position, quickly extend your left arm straight out (similar to a jab) and then bring it back to the starting position while simultaneously punching out with the right arm. Your torso and legs may slightly rotate side to side opposite of your hands throughout the movementâ€”this is okay. A punch with each hand counts as one total repetition. Repeat for recommended number of repetitions."
Standing cable low-to-high twist,strength,abdominals,cable,intermediate,"Connect a standard handle on a tower, and move the cable to the lowest pulley position. With your side to the cable, grab the handle with one hand and step away from the tower. You should be approximately armâ€™s length away from the pulley, with the tension of the weight on the cable. Your outstretched arm should be aligned with the cable. With your feet positioned shoulder width apart, squat down and grab the handle with both hands. Your arms should still be fully extended. In one motion, pull the handle up and across your body until your arms are in a fully-extended position above your head. Keep your back straight and your arms close to your body as you pivot your back foot and straighten your legs to get a full range of motion. Retract your arms and then your body. Return to the neutral position in a slow and controlled manner. Repeat to failure. Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.  Tip: You will twist your entire body with this exercise, but focus on getting maximal torso rotation and a strong clinch at the end of the movement. To ensure a good mind-muscle connection, keep your abs tense at all times."
Dumbbell spell caster,strength,abdominals,dumbbell,beginner,"Hold a dumbbell in each hand with a pronated grip. Your feet should be wide with your hips and knees extended. This will be your starting position. Begin the movement by pulling both of the dumbbells to one side next to your hip, rotating your torso. Keeping your arms straight and the dumbbells parallel to the ground, rotate your torso to swing the weights to your opposite side. Continue alternating, rotating from one side to the other until the set is complete."
Decline reverse crunch,strength,abdominals,other,intermediate,"Lie on your back on a decline bench and hold on to the top of the bench with both hands. Don't let your body slip down from this position. Hold your legs parallel to the floor using your abs to hold them there while keeping your knees and feet together. Tip: Your legs should be fully extended with a slight bend on the knee. This will be your starting position. While exhaling, move your legs towards the torso as you roll your pelvis backwards and you raise your hips off the bench. At the end of this movement your knees will be touching your chest. Hold the contraction for a second and move your legs back to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can do the movement on a flat surface and as you get more advanced you can use ankle weights."
Spider crawl,strength,abdominals,body_only,intermediate,"Begin in a prone position on the floor. Support your weight on your hands and toes, with your feet together and your body straight. Your arms should be bent to 90 degrees. This will be your starting position. Initiate the movement by raising one foot off of the ground. Externally rotate the leg and bring the knee toward your elbow, as far forward as possible. Return this leg to the starting position and repeat on the opposite side."
Cocoons,strength,abdominals,body_only,intermediate,"Begin by lying on your back on the ground. Your legs should be straight and your arms extended behind your head. This will be your starting position. To perform the movement, tuck the knees toward your chest, rotating your pelvis to lift your glutes from the floor. As you do so, flex the spine, bringing your arms back over your head to perform a simultaneous crunch motion. After a brief pause, return to the starting position."
Cross-Body Crunch,strength,abdominals,body_only,intermediate,Lie flat on your back and bend your knees about 60 degrees. Keep your feet flat on the floor and place your hands loosely behind your head. This will be your starting position. Now curl up and bring your right elbow and shoulder across your body while bring your left knee in toward your left shoulder at the same time. Reach with your elbow and try to touch your knee. Exhale as you perform this movement. Tip: Try to bring your shoulder up towards your knee rather than just your elbow and remember that the key is to contract the abs as you perform the movement; not just to move the elbow. Now go back down to the starting position as you inhale and repeat with the left elbow and the right knee. Continue alternating in this manner until all prescribed repetitions are done.  Variation: You can also do all of your repetitions for one side and then switch to the other side.
Single-arm high-cable side bend,strength,abdominals,cable,intermediate,"Connect a standard handle to a tower. Move cable to highest pulley position. Stand with side to cable. With one hand, reach up and grab handle with underhand grip. Pull down cable until elbow touches your side and the handle is by your shoulder. Position feet hip-width apart. Place free hand on hip to help gauge pivot point. Keep arm in static position. Contract oblique to bring the weight down in a side crunch. Once you reach maximum contraction, slowly release the weight to the starting position. The weight stack should never be unloaded in a resting position. The aim is constant tension during the set. Repeat to failure. Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.  Tip: Keep your arm tucked in tight to your side; donâ€™t move it. This technique will ensure the weight is isolated directly to the obliques and not your biceps or shoulder."
Elbow-to-knee crunch,strength,abdominals,body_only,intermediate,"Lie on the floor, crossing your right leg across your bent left knee. Clasp your hands behind your head, beginning with your shoulder blades on the ground. This will be your starting position.

Return to the starting position and repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions before switching sides."
Decline Crunch,strength,abdominals,body_only,intermediate,"Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down. Now place your hands lightly on either side of your head keeping your elbows in. Tip: Don't lock your fingers behind your head. While pushing the small of your back down in the bench to better isolate your abdominal muscles, begin to roll your shoulders off it. Continue to push down as hard as you can with your lower back as you contract your abdominals and exhale. Your shoulders should come up off the bench only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the bench. At the top of the movement, contract your abdominals hard and keep the contraction for a second. Tip: Focus on slow, controlled movement - don't cheat yourself by using momentum. After the one second contraction, begin to come down slowly again to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: There are many variations for the crunch. You can perform the exercise with weights, or on top of an exercise ball or on a flat bench."
Hanging toes-to-bar,strength,abdominals,body_only,intermediate,Hang from a chin-up bar with your legs and feet together using an overhand grip (palms facing away from you) that is slightly wider than shoulder width. Tip: You may use wrist wraps in order to facilitate holding on to the bar. Now bend your knees at a 90 degree angle and bring the upper legs forward so that the calves are perpendicular to the floor while the thighs remain parallel to it. This will be your starting position. Pull your legs up as you exhale until you almost touch your shins with the bar above you. Tip: Try to straighten your legs as much as possible while at the top. Lower your legs as slowly as possible until you reach the starting position. Tip: Avoid swinging and using momentum at all times. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can perform this exercise with ankle weights in order to make it more challenging.
Kneeling cable oblique crunch,strength,abdominals,cable,intermediate,"Connect a rope attachment to a high pulley cable and position the mat on the floor in front of you. Take the rope with both hands and kneel approximately 1-2 feet from the column. Position the rope behind your head; your hands being next to your ears. This will be your starting position. Keeping your hands in place, pull the rope downward in a crunching motion. As you flex the spine, twist to bring your elbow to the opposite knee. Pause briefly at the bottom of the motion, and then return to the starting position."
Hanging Oblique Knee Raise,strength,abdominals,body_only,intermediate,"Take a grip on pull-ups bars; hang with your knees together and your body straight. This will be your starting position. Initiate the movement by flexing the hips and knees, drawing the legs up. Pull the knees up into one side, going above 90 degrees at the hip. Avoid any swinging, performing the exercise with control. Return to the starting position and then perform the movement to the other side. Continue alternating until the set in complete."
Dumbbell suitcase crunch,strength,abdominals,medicine_ball,intermediate,"Begin by lying on your back on the ground.

Plate Twist,strength,abdominals,other,beginner,Lie down on the floor or an exercise mat with your legs fully extended and your upper body upright. Grab the plate by its sides with both hands out in front of your abdominals with your arms slightly bent. Slowly cross your legs near your ankles and lift them up off the ground. Your knees should also be bent slightly. Note: Move your upper body back slightly to help keep you balanced turning this exercise. This is the starting position. Move the plate to the left side and touch the floor with it. Breathe out as you perform that movement. Come back to the starting position as you breathe in and then repeat the movement but this time to the right side of the body. Tip: Use a slow controlled movement at all times. Jerking motions can injure the back. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
Gorilla Chin/Crunch,strength,abdominals,body_only,beginner,"Hang from a chin-up bar using an underhand grip (palms facing you) that is slightly wider than shoulder width. Now bend your knees at a 90 degree angle so that the calves are parallel to the floor while the thighs remain perpendicular to it. This will be your starting position. As you exhale, pull yourself up while crunching your knees up at the same time until your knees are at chest level. You will stop going up as soon as your nose is at the same level as the bar. Tip: When you get to this point you should also be finishing the crunch at the same time. Slowly start to inhale as you return to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can also add resistance by holding a dumbbell or medicine ball between your feet but this should only be done by the most advanced athletes. Alternatively, when you are very advanced you can also try the one-arm version where you grasp your wrist with your free hand and you work the obliques more."
Kneeling Cable Crunch With Alternating Oblique Twists,strength,abdominals,None,intermediate,"Connect a rope attachment to a high pulley cable and position a mat on the floor in front of it. Grab the rope with both hands and kneel approximately two feet back from the tower. Position the rope behind your head with your hands by your ears. Keep your hands in the same place, contract your abs and pull downward on the rope in a crunching movement until your elbows reach your knees. Pause briefly at the bottom and rise up in a slow and controlled manner until you reach the starting position. Repeat the same downward movement until youâ€™re halfway down, at which time youâ€™ll begin rotating one of your elbows to the opposite knee. Again, pause briefly at the bottom and rise up in a slow and controlled manner until you reach the starting position. Repeat the same movement as before, but alternate the other elbow to the opposite knee. Continue this series of movements to failure.  Tip: Keep your elbows in tight when doing the normal crunching movement, but extend them outward when doing the oblique twist. This technique will open your body for a greater rotation, as well as allow your elbow to drive backward with more force."
Weighted Crunches,strength,abdominals,other,intermediate,"Lie flat on your back with your feet flat on the ground or resting on a bench with your knees bent at a 90 degree angle. Hold a weight to your chest, or you may hold it extended above your torso. This will be your starting position. Now, exhale and slowly begin to roll your shoulders off the floor. Your shoulders should come up off the floor about 4 inches while your lower back remains on the floor. At the top of the movement, flex your abdominals and hold for a brief pause. Then inhale and slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position."
Barbell roll-out,strength,abdominals,barbell,intermediate,"For this exercise you will need to get into a pushup position, but instead of having your hands of the floor, you will be grabbing on to an Olympic barbell (loaded with 5-10 lbs on each side) instead. This will be your starting position. While keeping a slight arch on your back, lift your hips and roll the barbell towards your feet as you exhale. Tip: As you perform the movement, your glutes should be coming up, you should be keeping the abs tight and should maintain your back posture at all times. Also your arms should be staying perpendicular to the floor throughout the movement. If you don't, you will work out your shoulders and back more than the abs. After a second contraction at the top, start to roll the barbell back forward to the starting position slowly as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: This is a challenging exercise for people with healthy backs. Variation: This is an exercise that, just like the push-up, can also be done on the knees for less advanced athletes."
Kneeling cable crunch,strength,abdominals,cable,intermediate,"Kneel below a high pulley that contains a rope attachment. Grasp cable rope attachment and lower the rope until your hands are placed next to your face. Flex your hips slightly and allow the weight to hyperextend the lower back. This will be your starting position. With the hips stationary, flex the waist as you contract the abs so that the elbows travel towards the middle of the thighs. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement and hold the contraction for a second. Slowly return to the starting position as you inhale. Tip: Make sure that you keep constant tension on the abs throughout the movement. Also, do not choose a weight so heavy that the lower back handles the brunt of the work. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can perform this exercise with a handle instead so that you can concentrate on each side of the abs separately by performing the exercise to the side."
Exercise Ball Pull-In,strength,abdominals,exercise_ball,intermediate,"Place an exercise ball nearby and lay on the floor in front of it with your hands on the floor shoulder width apart in a push-up position. Now place your lower shins on top of an exercise ball. Tip: At this point your legs should be fully extended with the shins on top of the ball and the upper body should be in a push-up type of position being supported by your two extended arms in front of you. This will be your starting position. While keeping your back completely straight and the upper body stationary, pull your knees in towards your chest as you exhale, allowing the ball to roll forward under your ankles. Squeeze your abs and hold that position for a second. Now slowly straighten your legs, rolling the ball back to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
Hanging leg raise,strength,abdominals,body_only,intermediate,"Hang from a chin-up bar with both arms extended at arms length in top of you using either a wide grip or a medium grip. The legs should be straight down with the pelvis rolled slightly backwards. This will be your starting position. Raise your legs until the torso makes a 90-degree angle with the legs. Exhale as you perform this movement and hold the contraction for a second or so. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Perform this exercise slowly and deliberately as it takes some getting used to. Also, do not be hasty and try to use weights on the first time; you'll have enough in your hands by holding your weight and also learning how to balance yourself so that you avoid swinging your torso. As you get more advanced you can hold a dumbbell in between your feet. However, you have to be very careful when adding weight to this exercise as if you add too much too quickly you could get a hernia. Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a vertical bench that makes the exercise easier by supporting your upper back in place and by allowing you to hold yourself by placing your elbows and arms on the side pads."
Barbell Ab Rollout - On Knees,strength,abdominals,barbell,intermediate,"Hold an Olympic barbell loaded with 5-10lbs on each side and kneel on the floor. Now place the barbell on the floor in front of you so that you are on all your hands and knees (as in a kneeling push up position). This will be your starting position.

Slowly descend back to the starting position with your back arched around the Bosu Ball and your abdominals elongated. Repeat the same series of movements to failure. Once you reach failure, keep your abs tight and raise your torso into plank position so your back is elevated off the Bosu Ball. Lower your arms down to your side; keep them straight. Start doing alternating side bends; reach for your heels! This finishing movement will focus on your obliques.  Tip: Arch your back around the Bosu Ball before each rep to fully elongate your abdominals. This will provide a full range of motion and lengthen your muscle fibers, giving them a much fuller appearance."
Stomach Vacuum,stretching,abdominals,body_only,beginner,"To begin, stand straight with your feet shoulder width apart from each other. Place your hands on your hips. This is the starting position. Now slowly inhale as much air as possible and then start to exhale as much as possible while bringing your stomach in as much as possible and hold this position. Try to visualize your navel touching your backbone. One isometric contraction is around 20 seconds. During the 20 second hold, try to breathe normally. Then inhale and bring your stomach back to the starting position. Once you have practiced this exercise, try to perform this exercise for longer than 20 seconds. Tip: You can work your way up to 40-60 seconds. Repeat for the recommended amount of sets."
Exercise ball crunch,strength,abdominals,exercise_ball,intermediate,"Lie on an exercise ball with your lower back curvature pressed against the spherical surface of the ball. Your feet should be bent at the knee and pressed firmly against the floor. The upper torso should be hanging off the top of the ball. The arms should either be kept alongside the body or crossed on top of your chest as these positions avoid neck strains (as opposed to the hands behind the back of the head position). Lower your torso into a stretch position keeping the neck stationary at all times. This will be your starting position. With the hips stationary, flex the waist by contracting the abdominals and curl the shoulders and trunk upward until you feel a nice contraction on your abdominals. The arms should simply slide up the side of your legs if you have them at the side or just stay on top of your chest if you have them crossed. The lower back should always stay in contact with the ball. Exhale as you perform this movement and hold the contraction for a second. As you inhale, go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Perform this exercise slowly and deliberately as it takes some getting used to. Also, do not be hasty and try to use weights on the first time; you'll have enough on your hands learning how to balance yourself. Also, if balance is an issue I recommend having a spotter next to you and also placing each of your feet under a 100-lb dumbbell for added stability. As you get more advanced you can hold a dumbbell or a weight plate (held at arms length) on top of your chest. However, you have to be very careful when adding weight to this exercise, because if you add too much too quickly you could get a hernia. Variations: You can perform this exercise with a low pulley behind you with a rope attached on its end. In this manner you can go ahead and add resistance easier. For this variation, you will need to hold on to the sides of the rope throughout the movement. I like to bring my arms forward to the point that the upper arms are almost parallel to my torso and the lower arms are facing back holding the rope."
Russian twist,strength,abdominals,body_only,intermediate,"Lie down on the floor placing your feet either under something that will not move or by having a partner hold them. Your legs should be bent at the knees. Elevate your upper body so that it creates an imaginary V-shape with your thighs. Your arms should be fully extended in front of you perpendicular to your torso and with the hands clasped. This is the starting position. Twist your torso to the right side until your arms are parallel with the floor while breathing out. Hold the contraction for a second and move back to the starting position while breathing out. Now move to the opposite side performing the same techniques you applied to the right side. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variation: As you get more advanced, you can hold a weight with both arms for resistance."
Seated Flat Bench Leg Pull-In,strength,abdominals,None,intermediate,"Sit on a bench with the legs stretched out in front of you slightly below parallel and your arms holding on to the sides of the bench.

Bring the knees in toward you as you move your torso closer to them at the same time. Breathe out as you perform this movement. After a second pause, go back to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can also perform this exercise on a mat on the floor just by placing your arms to the sides. In this case, the legs will be stretched and elevated slightly over the floor. Also, as you become more advanced you can hold a dumbbell in between your feet or attach a pulley to them for added resistance. However, you have to be very careful when adding weight to this exercise as if you add too much too quickly you could get a hernia."
Flat Bench Lying Leg Raise,strength,abdominals,body_only,intermediate,"Lie with your back flat on a bench and your legs extended in front of you off the end. Place your hands either under your glutes with your palms down or by the sides holding on to the bench. This will be your starting position. As you keep your legs extended, straight as possible with your knees slightly bent but locked raise your legs until they make a 90-degree angle with the floor. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement and hold the contraction at the top for a second. Now, as you inhale, slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.  Variations: You can also perform this exercise on the floor on top of an exercise mat. You can also add weight by holding a dumbbell in between your feet as you get more advanced."

Slowly elevate your legs up in the air until your thighs are perpendicular to the floor with a slight bend at the knees. Note: Your knees and toes should be parallel to the floor as opposed to the thighs. Move your arms from the floor and cross them so they are resting on your chest. This is the starting position. While keeping your lower back pressed against the floor, slowly lift your torso. Remember to exhale while perform this part of the exercise. Slowly begin to lower your torso back down to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: This exercise can be performed with a weighted plate resting across your chest with your arms holding it. This can be a bit challenging for those who have never performed this exercise with weights. Always try the exercise without weights before moving to weighted plates. You can also perform this exercise with your hands clasped behind your head. This is a great way to add variety to your routine."
Butt-Ups,strength,abdominals,body_only,beginner,"Begin a pushup position but with your elbows on the ground and resting on your forearms. Your arms should be bent at a 90 degree angle. Arch your back slightly out rather than keeping your back completely straight. Raise your glutes toward the ceiling, squeezing your abs tightly to close the distance between your ribcage and hips. The end result will be that youâ€™ll end up in a high bridge position. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Lower back down slowly to your starting position as you breathe in. Tip: Don't let your back sag downwards. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: None"
Bench barbell roll-out,strength,abdominals,barbell,beginner,"Place a loaded barbell on the ground, near the end of a bench.

For this exercise, you will need to put one hand beside your head and the other to the side against the floor. Make sure your feet are elevated and resting on a flat surface. Now lift the shoulder in which your hand is touching your head. Simply elevate your shoulder and body upward until you touch your knee. For example, if you have your right hand besides your head, then you want to elevate your body upwards until your right elbow touches your left knee. The same variation can be applied doing the inverse and using your left elbow to touch your right knee. After your knee touches your elbow, lower your body until you have reached the starting position. Remember to breathe in during the eccentric (lowering) part of the exercise and to breathe out during the concentric (upward) part of the exercise. Continue alternating in this manner until all of the recommended repetitions for each side have been completed.  Note: While you cannot add resistance to this exercise you can concentrate on perfect execution and slow speed."

The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: If you suffer from lower back problems, a better exercise is the calf press as during a standing calf raise the back has to support the weight being lifted. Also, maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury. Variations: There are several other ways to perform a standing calf raise. A barbell instead of a machine can be used instead as well as dumbbells, one leg or two legs at a time. Refer to the exercise descriptions of these movements below. A smith machine can be used for calf raises as well."

Calf Press On The Leg Press Machine,strength,calves,machine,intermediate,"Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you without locking your knees. (Note: In some leg press units you can leave the safety bars on for increased safety. If your leg press unit allows for this, then this is the preferred method of performing the exercise.) Your torso and the legs should make perfect 90-degree angle. Now carefully place your toes and balls of your feet on the lower portion of the platform with the heels extending off. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position. Press on the platform by raising your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Rocking Standing Calf Raise,strength,calves,barbell,beginner,"This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place it on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck). Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance. Also maintain a straight back and keep the knees with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending (other than the slight initial bend we created during positioning) at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched. Now lift your toes by contracting the tibia muscles in the front of the calves as you breathe out. Hold for a second and bring them back down as you breathe in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury. Also, choose a conservative weight. This exercise requires a lot of balance and choosing too much weight may cause you to lose balance and fall. Variations: A smith machine can be used for this exercise as well and it is a better choice for those with poor balance. Dumbbells can be used also."

Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position. Tip: For better range of motion you may also place the ball of your feet on a wooden block but be careful as this option requires more balance and a sturdy block. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: If you suffer from lower back problems, a better exercise is the calf press as during a standing calf raise the back has to support the weight being lifted. Also, maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury. Variations: There are several other ways to perform a standing calf raise. A calf press machine instead of a squat rack can be used as well as dumbbells with one leg or two legs at a time. A smith machine can be used for calf raises as well. You can also perform the barbell calf raise using a piece of wood to place the ball of the foot. This will allow you to get a better range of motion. However be cautious as in this case you will need to balance yourself much better."

Dumbbell Bench Press,strength,chest,dumbbell,intermediate,"Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other. Then, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width. Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position. Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.  Caution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you. Just lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you can place the dumbbells on the floor. Variations: Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each other. Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body. I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my shoulders."
Pushups,strength,chest,body_only,intermediate,"Lie on the floor face down and place your hands about 36 inches apart while holding your torso up at arms length. Next, lower yourself downward until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale. Now breathe out and press your upper body back up to the starting position while squeezing your chest. After a brief pause at the top contracted position, you can begin to lower yourself downward again for as many repetitions as needed.  Variations: If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, you can either bend your legs at the knees to take off resistance or perform the exercise against the wall instead of the floor. For the most advanced lifters, you can place your feet at a high surface such as a bench in order to increase the resistance and to target the upper chest more."
Close-grip bench press,strength,chest,barbell,intermediate,"Lie back on a flat bench. Using a close grip (around shoulder width), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position. As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest. Tip: Make sure that - as opposed to a regular bench press - you keep the elbows close to the torso at all times in order to maximize triceps involvement. After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your triceps muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.  Caution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used. Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall on your middle chest and nowhere else. Variations: This exercise can also be performed with an e-z bar using the inner handle as well as dumbbells, in which case the palms of the hands will be facing each other."
Dumbbell Flyes,strength,chest,dumbbell,intermediate,"Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell on each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other. Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width with the palms of your hands facing each other. Raise the dumbbells up like you're pressing them, but stop and hold just before you lock out. This will be your starting position. With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint. Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights. Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations: You may want to use a palms facing forward version for different stimulation."
Incline dumbbell bench press,strength,chest,dumbbell,intermediate,"Lie back on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand atop your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other. Then, using your thighs to help push the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them at shoulder width.

Be sure to keep full control of the dumbbells at all times. Then breathe out and push the dumbbells up with your chest. Lock your arms at the top, hold for a second, and then start slowly lowering the weight. Tip Ideally, lowering the weights should take about twice as long as raising them. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. When you are done, place the dumbbells back on your thighs and then on the floor. This is the safest manner to release the dumbbells.  Variations: You can use several angles on the incline bench if the bench you are using is adjustable. Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each other. Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body. I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my shoulders."
Low-cable cross-over,strength,chest,cable,intermediate,"To move into the starting position, place the pulleys at the low position, select the resistance to be used and grasp a handle in each hand. Step forward, gaining tension in the pulleys. Your palms should be facing forward, hands below the waist, and your arms straight. This will be your starting position.

You should be in full control of the barbell at all times."
Chest dip,strength,chest,other,intermediate,"For this exercise you will need access to parallel bars. To get yourself into the starting position, hold your body at arms length (arms locked) above the bars. While breathing in, lower yourself slowly with your torso leaning forward around 30 degrees or so and your elbows flared out slightly until you feel a slight stretch in the chest. Once you feel the stretch, use your chest to bring your body back to the starting position as you breathe out. Tip: Remember to squeeze the chest at the top of the movement for a second. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations: If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a dip assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight. Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help. More advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates."
Decline Dumbbell Flyes,strength,chest,dumbbell,intermediate,"Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down with a dumbbell on each hand on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other. Once you are laying down, move the dumbbells in front of you at shoulder width.

As you breathe out, push the dumbbells up using your pectoral muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.  Caution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you. If using really heavy weights, it is best if a partner gives them to you as you lay down. Variations: You can use an exercise band or a barbell to perform this exercise. Similar to the Dumbbell Bench Press but on a decline bench. This works more of the lower chest."
Single-arm kettlebell row,strength,chest,dumbbell,intermediate,"Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in one hand on top of your thigh. By using your thigh to help you get the dumbbell up, clean the dumbbell up so that you can hold it in front of you at shoulder width. Use the hand you are not lifting with to help position the dumbbell over you properly. Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrist forward so that the palm of your hand is facing away from you. This will be your starting position. Bring down the weights slowly to your side as you breathe in. Keep full control of the dumbbell at all times. Tip: Use the hand that you are not lifting with to help keep the dumbbell balance as you may struggle a bit at first. Only use your non-lifting hand if it is needed. Otherwise, keep it resting to the side. As you breathe out, push the dumbbells up using your pectoral muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program. Switch arms and repeat the movement.  Caution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbell next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you. Just lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrist so that you can place the dumbbell on top of your thigh. When the dumbbell is touching your thigh simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbell on your thigh) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbell on top of the thigh). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with the dumbbell still on top of your thigh. At this moment you can place the dumbbell on the floor."

Barbell Deadlift,strength,hamstrings,barbell,intermediate,"Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. Your feet should be about hip-width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder-width allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an alternating grip. With your feet and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and flex the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head. Keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar. Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor."
Romanian Deadlift With Dumbbells,strength,hamstrings,dumbbell,beginner,"Begin in a standing position with a dumbbell in each hand. Ensure that your back is straight and stays that way for the duration of the exercise. Allow your arms to hang perpendicular to the floor, with the wrists pronated and the elbows pointed to your sides. This will be your starting position. Initiate the movement by flexing your hips, slowly pushing your butt as far back as you can. This should entail a horizontal movement of the hips, rather than a downward movement. The knees should only partially bend, and your weight should remain on your heels. Drive your butt back as far as you can, which should generate tension in your hamstrings as your hands approach knee level. Maintain an arch in your back throughout the exercise. When your hips cannot perform any further backward movement, pause, and then slowly return to the starting position by extending the hips."
Clean Deadlift,olympic_weightlifting,hamstrings,barbell,beginner,"Begin standing with a barbell close to your shins. Your feet should be directly under your hips with your feet turned out slightly. Grip the bar with a double overhand grip or hook grip, about shoulder width apart. Squat down to the bar. Your spine should be in full extension, with a back angle that places your shoulders in front of the bar and your back as vertical as possible. Begin by driving through the floor through the front of your heels. As the bar travels upward, maintain a constant back angle. Flare your knees out to the side to help keep them out of the bar's path. After the bar crosses the knees, complete the lift by driving the hips into the bar until your hips and knees are extended."
Sumo deadlift,powerlifting,hamstrings,barbell,beginner,"Begin with a bar loaded on the ground. Approach the bar so that the bar intersects the middle of the feet. The feet should be set very wide, near the collars. Bend at the hips to grip the bar. The arms should be directly below the shoulders, inside the legs, and you can use a pronated grip, a mixed grip, or hook grip. Relax the shoulders, which in effect lengthens your arms. Take a breath, and then lower your hips, looking forward with your head with your chest up. Drive through the floor, spreading your feet apart, with your weight on the back half of your feet. Extend through the hips and knees. As the bar passes through the knees, lean back and drive the hips into the bar, pulling your shoulder blades together. Return the weight to the ground by bending at the hips and controlling the weight on the way down."
Romanian Deadlift from Deficit,olympic_weightlifting,hamstrings,barbell,beginner,"Begin standing while holding a bar at armâ€™s length in front of you. You can stand on a raised platform to increase the range of motion. Begin by flexing the knees slightly, and then flex at the hip, moving your butt back as far as possible, lowering the torso as far as flexibility allows.

The feet should be directly below the hips, with the feet turned out as needed. Lower the hips, with the chest up and the head looking forward. The shoulders should be just in front of the bar. This will be the starting position. Begin the first pull by driving through the front of the heels, raising the bar from the ground. The back angle should stay the same until the bar passes the knees. Transition into the second pull by extending through the hips knees and ankles, driving the bar up as quickly as possible. The bar should be close to the body. At peak extension, shrug the shoulders and allow the elbows to flex to the side. As you move your feet into the receiving position, a slightly wider position, pull yourself below the bar as you elevate the bar overhead. The bar should be received in a partial squat. Continue raising the bar to the overhead position, receiving the bar locked out overhead. Return to a standing position with the weight over head."
Power Clean from Blocks,olympic_weightlifting,hamstrings,barbell,beginner,"With a barbell on boxes of the desired height, take a grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position. Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight. At the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended. As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, pull yourself under the bar far enough that it can be racked onto the shoulders, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position, and complete the repetition by returning the weight to the boxes."
Natural Glute Ham Raise,strength,hamstrings,body_only,beginner,"Using the leg pad of a lat pulldown machine or a preacher bench, position yourself so that your ankles are under the pads, knees on the seat, and you are facing away from the machine. You should be upright and maintaining good posture. This will be your starting position. Lower yourself under control until your knees are almost completely straight. Remaining in control, raise yourself back up to the starting position. If you are unable to complete a rep, use a band, a partner, or push off of a box to aid in completing a repetition."
Glute ham raise-,strength,hamstrings,none,beginner,"You can use a partner for this exercise or brace your feet under something stable. Begin on your knees with your upper legs and torso upright. If using a partner, they will firmly hold your feet to keep you in position. This will be your starting position. Lower yourself by extending at the knee, taking care to NOT flex the hips as you go forward. Place your hands in front of you as you reach the floor. This movement is very difficult and you may be unable to do it unaided. Use your arms to lightly push off the floor to aid your return to the starting position."
Snatch Deadlift,olympic_weightlifting,hamstrings,barbell,beginner,"The snatch deadlift strengthens the first pull of the snatch. Begin with a wide snatch grip with the barbell placed on the platform. The feet should be directly under the hips, with the feet turned out. Squat down to the bar, keeping the back in absolute extension with the head facing forward.

Lying Leg Curls,strength,hamstrings,machine,beginner,"Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and lie face down on the leg curl machine with the pad of the lever on the back of your legs (just a few inches under the calves). Tip: Preferably use a leg curl machine that is angled as opposed to flat since an angled position is more favorable for hamstrings recruitment. Keeping the torso flat on the bench, ensure your legs are fully stretched and grab the side handles of the machine. Position your toes straight (or you can also use any of the other two stances described on the foot positioning section). This will be your starting position. As you exhale, curl your legs up as far as possible without lifting the upper legs from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second. As you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Do not ever use so much weight on the exercise that you start using swinging and jerking as you can risk both lower back injury and also a hamstring injury. Variations: Since you have three foot positions you have in reality three exercises. The movement can also be performed with a dumbbell held in between your feet (a partner needs to place it properly). This latter exercise though is only suitable for advanced trainees. Finally, it is also possible to just use one leg at a time for better isolation."

Phase 1: Starting Position  Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart and toes pointing out slightly. Squat down and grasp bar with a closed, pronated grip. Your hands should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart outside knees with elbows fully extended. Place the bar about 1 inch in front of your shins and over the balls of your feet. Your back should be flat or slightly arched, your chest held up and out and your shoulder blades should be retracted. Keep your head in a neutral position (in line with vertebral column and not tilted or rotated) with your eyes focused straight ahead. Inhale during this phase.  Phase 2: First Pull Phase  Lift the bar from the floor by forcefully extending the hips and the knees as you exhale. Tip: The upper torso should maintain the same angle. Do not bend at the waist yet and do not let the hips rise before the shoulders (this would have the effect of pushing the glutes in the air and stretching the hamstrings. Keep elbows fully extended with the head in a neutral position and the shoulders over the bar. As the bar raises keep it as close to the shins as possible.  Phase 3: Transition or Scoop Phase  As the bar passes the knees, thrust your hips forward and slightly bend the knees to avoid locking them. Tip: At this point your thighs should be against the bar. Keep the back flat or slightly arched, elbows fully extended and your head neutral. Tip: You will hold your breath until the next phase.  Phase 4: Second Pull Phase  Inhale and then forcefully and quickly extend your hips and knees and stand on your toes. Keep the bar as close to your body as possible. Tip: Your back should be flat with the elbows pointed out to the sides and your head in a neutral position. Also, keep your shoulders over the bar and arms straight as long as possible. When your lower body joints are fully extended, shrug the shoulders upward rapidly without letting the elbows flex yet. Exhale during this portion of the movement. As the shoulders reach their highest elevation flex your elbows to begin pulling your body under the bar. Continue to pull the arms as high and as long as possible. Tip: Due to the explosive nature of this phase, your torso will be erect or with an arched back, your head will be tilted back slightly and your feet may lose contact with the floor.  Phase 5: Catch Phase  After the lower body has fully extended and the bar reaches near maximal height, pull your body under the bar and rotate the arms around and under the bar. Simultaneously, flex the hips and knees into a quarter squat position. Once the arms are under the bar, inhale and then lift your elbows to position the upper arms parallel to the floor. Rack the bar across the front of your collar bones and front shoulder muscles. Catch the bar with an erect and tight torso, a neutral head position and flat feet. Exhale during this movement. Stand up by extending the hips and knees to a fully erect position.  Phase 6: Downward Movement Phase  Lower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular tension of the arms to allow a controlled descent of the bar to the thighs. Inhale during this movement. Simultaneously flex the hips and knees to cushion the impact of the bar on the thighs. Squat down with the elbows fully extended until the bar touches the floor. Start over at Phase 1 and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

After a second of contraction, inhale as you go back to the starting position. Repeat steps 3-6 until you have performed the prescribed amount of repetitions for each side.  Caution: If you are new to this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, using a spotter to hold your legs can help being that it requires putting a lot of stress on the rotator cuffs. Alternatively you can also use a chin assist machine. Variations: If you have developed enough strength to perform this exercise with weights, do so with caution. Side to side chins can be a challenging exercise and if not performed correctly, can cause injury. Before attempting to use weights, make sure you are able to perform the exercise with good form. You can also perform the side to side chins by doing all reps to one side and then the next or by also including the middle movement as well (in which case you would pull up first to the left hand side, then the middle and then the right side). You can use a chin assist machine if you do not have the strength to perform the exercise on your own."
Machine seated row,strength,lats,machine,beginner,"Load an appropriate weight onto the pins and adjust the seat height so that the handles are at chest level. Grasp the handles with either a neutral or pronated grip. This will be your starting position. Pull the handles towards your torso, retracting your shoulder blades as you flex the elbow. Pause at the bottom of the motion, and then slowly return the handles to the starting position. For multiple repetitions, avoid completely returning the weight to the stops to keep tension on the muscles being worked."
Straight-Arm Pulldown,strength,lats,cable,intermediate,"You will start by grabbing the wide bar from the top pulley of a pulldown machine and using a wider than shoulder-width pronated (palms down) grip. Step backwards two feet or so. Bend your torso forward at the waist by around 30-degrees with your arms fully extended in front of you and a slight bend at the elbows. If your arms are not fully extended then you need to step a bit more backwards until they are. Once your arms are fully extended and your torso is slightly bent at the waist, tighten the lats and then you are ready to begin. While keeping the arms straight, pull the bar down by contracting the lats until your hands are next to the side of the thighs. Breathe out as you perform this step. While keeping the arms straight, go back to the starting position while breathing in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: Can also be performed with a shorter shoulder-width straight bar or with a rope attachment."
Single-arm kneeling lat pull-down,strength,lats,cable,beginner,"Attach a single handle to a high pulley and make your weight selection. Kneel in front of the cable tower, taking the cable with one hand with your arm extended. This will be your starting position. Starting with your palm facing forward, pull the weight down to your torso by flexing the elbow and retract the shoulder blade. As you do so, rotate the wrist so that at the completion of the movement, your palm is now facing you. After a brief pause, return to the starting position."
Elevated Cable Rows,strength,lats,cable,beginner,"Get a platform of some sort (it can be an aerobics or calf raise platform) that is around 4-6 inches in height. Place it on the seat of the cable row machine. Sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked. Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles. With your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is the starting position of the exercise. Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Avoid swinging your torso back and forth as you can cause lower back injury by doing so. Variations: You can use a straight bar instead of a V-Bar and perform with a pronated grip (palms facing down-forward) or a supinated grip (palms facing up-reverse grip)."
Neutral-grip pull-up,strength,lats,body_only,intermediate,"Take a neutral grip on parallel pull-up bars, hanging freely with your arms extended. This will be your starting position. Pull yourself up by flexing the elbows and extending the glenohumeral joint. Do not swing or use momentum to complete the movement. Attempt to get your chin above your hands. Pause at the top of the motion before lowering yourself to the starting position."
Machine-assisted pull-up,strength,lats,machine,beginner,"Use an assisted pull-up machine or securely attach a heavy-duty band to a pull-up station, securing it around just one knee. The tension should be taut enough to pull that lower leg up. Grasp the bar with an overhand grip just outside shoulder width and hang at full arm extension. This is your start position. Keeping your body straight, contract your lats to pull yourself up as high as you can, driving your elbows down. Slowly release to full arm extension. Repeat for the required number of reps and safely dismount from the apparatus."
Full Range-Of-Motion Lat Pulldown,strength,lats,cable,beginner,"Either standing or seated on a high bench, grasp two stirrup cables that are attached to the high pulleys. Grab with the opposing hand so your arms are crisscrossed about you and your palms are facing forward. Keeping your chest up and maintaining a slight arch in your lower back, pull the handles down as if you were doing a regular pulldown. The range of motion will be more of an arc. During the movement, rotate your hands so that in the bottom position your palms face each other rather than forward. Return slowly to the starting position and repeat."
Bent-arm barbell pull-over,strength,lats,barbell,intermediate,"Lie on a flat bench with a barbell using a shoulder grip width. Hold the bar straight over your chest with a bend in your arms. This will be your starting position. While keeping your arms in the bent arm position, lower the weight slowly in an arc behind your head while breathing in until you feel a stretch on the chest. At that point, bring the barbell back to the starting position using the arc through which the weight was lowered and exhale as you perform this movement. Hold the weight on the initial position for a second and repeat the motion for the prescribed number of repetitions.  Variations:  You can perform this exercise using a dumbbell or an E-Z bar instead of dumbbells."
Kneeling lat pull-down,strength,lats,cable,intermediate,"Select the appropriate weight using a pulley that is above your head. Attach a rope to the cable and kneel a couple of feet away, holding the rope out in front of you with both arms extended. This will be your starting position. Initiate the movement by flexing the elbows and fully retracting your shoulders, pulling the rope toward your upper chest with your elbows out. After pausing briefly, slowly return to the starting position."
Medicine ball slam,plyometrics,lats,medicine_ball,intermediate,"Hold a medine ball with both hands and stand with your feet at shoulder width. This will be your starting position. Initiate the countermovement by raising the ball above your head and fully extending your body. Reverse the motion, slamming the ball into the ground directly in front of you as hard as you can. Receive the ball with both hands on the bounce and repeat the movement."
Band-assisted pull-up,strength,lats,bands,intermediate,"Choke the band around the center of the pullup bar. You can use different bands to provide varying levels of assistance. Pull the end of the band down, and place one bent knee into the loop, ensuring it won't slip out. Take a medium to wide grip on the bar. This will be your starting position. Pull yourself upward by contracting the lats as you flex the elbow. The elbow should be driven to your side. Pull to the front, attempting to get your chin over the bar. Avoid swinging or jerking movements. After a brief pause, return to the starting position."
Single-arm pull-down,strength,lats,machine,intermediate,"Select an appropriate weight and adjust the knee pad to help keep you down. Grasp the handle with a pronated grip. This will be your starting position. Pull the handle down, squeezing your elbow to your side as you flex the elbow. Pause at the bottom of the motion, and then slowly return the handle to the starting position. For multiple repetitions, avoid completely returning the weight to keep tension on the muscles being worked."
Cable Incline Pushdown,strength,lats,None,intermediate,"Lie on incline an bench facing away from a high pulley machine that has a straight bar attachment on it. Grasp the straight bar attachment overhead with a pronated (overhand; palms down) shoulder width grip and extend your arms in front of you. The bar should be around 2 inches away from your upper thighs. This will be your starting position. Keeping the upper arms stationary, lift your arms back in a semi circle until the bar is straight over your head. Breathe in during this portion of the movement. Slowly go back to the starting position using your lats and hold the contraction once you reach the starting position. Breathe out during the execution of this movement. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can also use an angled attachment or a rope attachment as well. Finally, you can perform one arm at a time by using a single handle attachment."
Kipping Muscle Up,strength,lats,body_only,intermediate,"Grip the rings using a false grip, with the base of your palms on top of the rings. Begin with a movement swinging your legs backward slightly. Counter that movement by swinging your legs forward and up, jerking your chin and chest back, pulling yourself up with both arms as you do so. As you reach the top position of the pull-up, pull the rings to your armpits as you roll your shoulders forward, allowing your elbows to move straight back behind you. This puts you into the proper position to continue into the dip portion of the movement. Maintaining control and stability, extend through the elbow to complete the motion. Use care when lowering yourself to the ground."
Behind-the-neck pull-down,strength,lats,cable,intermediate,"Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar. Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso and head forward. Think of an imaginary line from the center of the bar down to the back of your neck. This is your starting position. As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches the back of your neck by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms. After a second on the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Caution: Performing this exercise can be hard on the rotator cuffs and if not properly executed can cause an injury to occur. Also, if you already have rotator cuff issues, I advise you to stick to the front pull-down version. Variations: You can also performing this exercise by bring the bar down and touching your chest. This variation is safer and not as hard on the rotator cuffs."
Floor rope climb,strength,lats,other,beginner,"Attach a climbing rope to a high beam or cross member. Below it, ensure that the smith machine bar is locked in place with the safeties and cannot move. Alternatively, a secure box could also be utilized. Stand on the bar, using the rope to balance yourself. This will be your starting position. Keeping your body straight, lean back and lower your body by slowly going hand over hand with the rope. Continue until you are perpendicular to the ground. Keeping your body straight, reverse the motion, going hand over hand back to the starting position."
One Arm Against Wall,stretching,lats,body_only,intermediate,"From a standing position, place a bent arm against a wall or doorway. Slowly lean toward your arm until you feel a stretch in your lats."
Catch and Overhead Throw,plyometrics,lats,medicine_ball,beginner,"Begin standing while facing a wall or a partner. Using both hands, position the ball behind your head, stretching as much as possible, and forcefully throw the ball forward. Ensure that you follow your throw through, being prepared to receive your rebound from your throw. If you are throwing against the wall, make sure that you stand close enough to the wall to receive the rebound, and aim a little higher than you would with a partner."
Dynamic Back Stretch,stretching,lats,none,beginner,"Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. This will be your starting position. Keeping your arms straight, swing them straight up in front of you 5-10 times, increasing the range of motion each time until your arms are above your head."

Burpee to pull-up,plyometrics,lats,body_only,intermediate,"Begin standing under a bar with your legs shoulder-width apart. This will be your starting position. Descend into a squat by pushing your hips and butt backwards. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Place your hands on the floor and kick your legs back so you end up with your stomach and thighs on the floor. Your elbows should be bent. This should be done quickly. From this position, press up like you're doing a push-up and push your hips up. Jump your feet under your hips and begin to stand as you prepare to jump up. Finish the movement by jumping in the air and bringing your hands over your head to grab a strong hold on the bar. Immediately pull yourself up until your chin is just above the bar. This is one repetition. Descend from the pull-up by allowing your arms to extend and then let go of the bar to return to the ground. Repeat for recommended number of repetitions."
Barbell pull-over to press,strength,lats,barbell,beginner,"Lay on a flat bench with your feet flat on the floor. Hold a barbell on your chest with a shoulder-width, pronated grip. This will be your starting position. Keeping the elbows bent to about 90 degrees, rotate the barbell over and behind your head. Return the barbell to your chest, again keeping the elbows again fixed at the same angle. Press the barbell straight up by extending the elbows, and then return the weight to the starting position."
Around-the-world pull-up,strength,lats,other,beginner,"With a grip well outside shoulder width, hang freely from an overhead bar as you would doing a pull-up. This will be your starting position. Instead of pulling yourself directly up to the bar, contract your lats to instead go in a counter-clockwise direction, pulling yourself partway up to the right side and continue going upward as you move back toward the center of the bar. Here your chin should meet the bar at the apex of the move. Continue in a circular motion until you are back to the center, reaching full arm extension. Complete for the designated number of reps in the same counter-clockwise motion. Because of the asymmetrical motion youâ€™ll repeat the move for the same number of reps going in a clockwise direction as well."
Assisted Chin-Up,strength,lats,bands,beginner,"Use an assisted pull-up machine or securely attach a heavy-duty band to a pull-up station, securing it around just one knee. The tension should be taut enough to pull that lower leg up. Grasp the bar with an underhand grip, about shoulder-width apart, and hang at full arm extension. This is your start position. Keeping your body straight, contract your biceps and lats to pull yourself up as high as you can, driving your elbows down. Slowly release to full arm extension. Repeat for the required number of repetitions and safely dismount from the apparatus."
L-sit chin-up,strength,lats,other,beginner,"With an underhand, shoulder-width grip, hang from a pull-up bar, then elevate your feet by bending at the hips so that your legs are now perpendicular to your torso.

Atlas Stones,strongman,lower_back,other,intermediate,"Begin with the atlas stone between your feet. Bend at the hips to wrap your arms vertically around the Atlas Stone, attempting to get your fingers underneath the stone. Many stones will have a small flat portion on the bottom, which will make the stone easier to hold. Pulling the stone into your torso, drive through the back half of your feet to pull the stone from the ground. As the stone passes the knees, lap it by sitting backward, pulling the stone on top of your thighs. Sit low, getting the stone high onto your chest as you change your grip to reach over the stone. Stand, driving through with your hips. Close distance to the loading platform, and lean back, extending the hips to get the stone as high as possible."
Barbell deficit deadlift,powerlifting,lower_back,barbell,beginner,"Begin by having a platform or weight plates that you can stand on, usually 1-3 inches in height. Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width, allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an overhand grip or an over/under grip on heavier sets. With your feet, and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and bend the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head, keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar. Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor."
Back extension,strength,lower_back,body_only,intermediate,"Lie face down on a hyperextension bench, tucking your ankles securely under the footpads. Adjust the upper pad if possible so your upper thighs lie flat across the wide pad, leaving enough room for you to bend at the waist without any restriction. With your body straight, cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms. Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings and you can no longer keep going without a rounding of the back. Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Also, some people can go farther than others. The key thing is that you go as far as your body allows you to without rounding the back. Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you inhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: This exercise can also be performed without a hyperextension bench, but in this case you will need a spotter. Also, a similar exercise to this one is the good morning and the stiff-legged deadlift."
Axle Deadlift,strongman,lower_back,other,beginner,"Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart.

Look forward with your head, keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar. Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor."
Hyperextensions With No Hyperextension Bench,strength,lower_back,body_only,beginner,"With someone holding down your legs, slide yourself down to the edge a flat bench until your hips hang off the end of the bench. Tip: Your entire upper body should be hanging down towards the floor. Also, you will be in the same position as if you were on a hyperextension bench but the range of motion will be shorter due to the height of the flat bench vs. that of the hyperextension bench. With your body straight, cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms. Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you almost touch the floor or you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings (whichever comes first). Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you exhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a hyperextension bench. Also, a similar exercise to this one is the good morning and the stiff-legged deadlift."
Deadlift with Bands,powerlifting,lower_back,barbell,beginner,"To deadlift with short bands, simply loop them over the bar before you start, and step into them to set up. For long bands, they will need to be anchored to a secure base, such as heavy dumbbells or a rack. Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Ensure that the bands are under the back half of your foot (for short bands), directly where you are driving into the floor. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width, allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an overhand grip or an over/under grip on heavier sets.2.

The pins should be set to the desired point; just below the knees, just above, or in the mid thigh position. Attach bands to the base of the rack, or secure them with dumbbells. Attach the other end to the bar. You may need to choke the bands to provide tension. Position yourself against the bar in proper deadlifting position. Your feet should be under your hips, your grip shoulder width, back arched, and hips back to engage the hamstrings. Since the weight is typically heavy, you may use a mixed grip, a hook grip, or use straps to aid in holding the weight. With your head looking forward, extend through the hips and knees, pulling the weight up and back until lockout. Be sure to pull your shoulders back as you complete the movement. Return the weight to the pins and repeat."

Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders, not on top of your traps. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back. Keep your head facing forward. With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. This will be your starting position. Keeping the bar tight, bend forward at the hips as much as possible. If you set the pins to what would be parallel, you not only have a safety if you fail, but know when to stop. Pause just above the pins and reverse the motion until your torso it upright."
Stiff Leg Barbell Good Morning,strength,lower_back,barbell,beginner,"This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it. Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. Keeping your legs stationary, move your torso forward by bending at the hips while inhaling. Lower your torso until it is parallel with the floor. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by elevating your torso back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The stiff-legged barbell good morning is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly."
Atlas Stone Trainer,strongman,lower_back,other,beginner,"This trainer is effective for developing Atlas Stone strength for those who don't have access to stones, and are typically made from bar ends or heavy pipe. Begin by loading the desired weight onto the bar. Straddle the weight, wrapping your arms around the implement, bending at the hips. Begin by pulling the weight up past the knees, extending through the hips. As the weight clears the knees, it can be lapped by resting it on your thighs and sitting back, hugging it tightly to your chest. Finish the movement by extending through your hips and knees to raise the weight as high as possible. The weight can be returned to the lap or to the ground for successive repetitions."
Hug A Ball,stretching,lower_back,body_only,intermediate,Seat yourself on the floor. Straddle an exercise ball between both legs and lower your hips down toward the floor. Hug your arms around the ball to support your body. Adjust your legs so that your feet are flat on the floor and your knees line up over your ankles. Keep a good grip on the ball so it doesn't roll away from you and send you back onto your buttocks.

Rest your hands and feet on the floor. Your arms and legs can be slightly bent or straight, depending on the size of the ball, your flexibility, and the length of your limbs. This also helps develop stabilizing strength in your torso and shoulders."
Reverse Band Deadlift,powerlifting,lower_back,barbell,beginner,"Set the bar up in a power rack. Attach bands to the top of the rack, using either bands pegs or the frame itself. Attach the other end of the bands to the bar. Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width, allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an overhand grip or an over/under grip on heavier sets. With your feet, and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and bend the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head, keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar. Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor."

Keg Load,strongman,lower_back,other,beginner,"To load kegs, place the desired number a distance from the loading platform, typically 30-50 feet. Begin by grabbing the close handle of the first keg, tilting it onto its side to grab the opposite edge of the bottom of the keg. Lift the keg up to your chest. The higher you can place the keg, the faster you should be able to move to the platform. Shouldering is usually not allowed. Be sure to keep a firm hold on the keg. Move as quickly as possible to the platform, and load it, extending through your hips, knees, and ankles to get it as high as possible. Return to the starting position to retrieve the next keg, and repeat until the event is completed."

Reverse-grip bent-over row,strength,middle_back,barbell,intermediate,"Stand erect while holding a barbell with a supinated grip (palms facing up). Bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position. While keeping the torso stationary, lift the barbell as you breathe out, keeping the elbows close to the body and not doing any force with the forearm other than holding the weights. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second. Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution:  This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues. Also, just like with the bent knee dead-lift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  Variations: You can perform the same exercise using a pronated (palms facing out) grip or using dumbbells."
One-Arm Dumbbell Row,strength,middle_back,dumbbell,intermediate,"Choose a flat bench and place a dumbbell on each side of it. Place the right leg on top of the end of the bench, bend your torso forward from the waist until your upper body is parallel to the floor, and place your right hand on the other end of the bench for support. Use the left hand to pick up the dumbbell on the floor and hold the weight while keeping your lower back straight. The palm of the hand should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position. Pull the resistance straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side and keeping the torso stationary. Breathe out as you perform this step. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. Also, make sure that the force is performed with the back muscles and not the arms. Finally, the upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the dumbbell; therefore do not try to pull the dumbbell up using the forearms. Lower the resistance straight down to the starting position. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat the movement for the specified amount of repetitions. Switch sides and repeat again with the other arm.  Variations: One-arm rows can also be performed using a high pulley or a low pulley instead of a dumbbell."
One-Arm Long Bar Row,strength,middle_back,barbell,intermediate,"Position a bar into a landmine or in a corner to keep it from moving. Load an appropriate weight onto your end. Stand next to the bar, and take a grip with one hand close to the collar. Using your hips and legs, rise to a standing position. Assume a bent-knee stance with your hips back and your chest up. Your arm should be extended. This will be your starting position. Pull the weight to your side by retracting the shoulder and flexing the elbow. Do not jerk the weight or cheat during the movement. After a brief pause, return to the starting position."
T-Bar Row,strength,middle_back,other,intermediate,"Load the bar to an appropriate weight for your training. Stand astride the bar and bend at the hips to take a pronated grip on the handles. Ensure that your back remains flat, and then remove the weight from the rests, letting the bar hang at arms length. This will be your starting position. Perform the movement by flexing the elbows and retracting the shoulder blades, pulling the weight to your chest. After a brief pause at the top of the motion, return to the starting position."
Bent Over Two-Arm Long Bar Row,strength,middle_back,barbell,intermediate,"Put weight on one of the ends of an Olympic barbell. Make sure that you either place the other end of the barbell in the corner of two walls; or put a heavy object on the ground so the barbell cannot slide backward. Bend forward until your torso is as close to parallel with the floor as you can and keep your knees slightly bent. Now grab the bar with both arms just behind the plates on the side where the weight was placed and put your other hand on your knee. This will be your starting position. Pull the bar straight up with your elbows in (to maximize back stimulation) until the plates touch your lower chest. Squeeze the back muscles as you lift the weight up and hold for a second at the top of the movement. Breathe out as you lift the weight. Tip: Use a stirrup or double handle cable attachment by hooking it under the end of the bar. Slowly lower the bar to the starting position getting a nice stretch on the lats. Tip: Do not let the plates touch the floor. To ensure the best range of motion, I recommend using small plates (25-lb ones) as opposed to larger plates (like 35-45lb ones). Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can perform this exercise using a low pulley or T-bar row machine."

Rower,cardio,middle_back,machine,intermediate,"To begin, seat yourself on the rower. Make sure that your heels are resting comfortably against the base of the foot pedals and that the straps are secured. Select the program that you wish to use, if applicable. Sit up straight and bend forward at the hips. There are three phases of movement when using a rower. The first phase is when you come forward on the rower. Your knees are bent and against your chest. Your upper body is leaning slightly forward while still maintaining good posture.Next, push against the foot pedals and extend your legs while bringing your hands to your upper abdominal area, squeezing your shoulders back as you do so. To avoid straining your back, use primarily your leg and hip muscles. The recovery phase simply involves straightening your arms, bending the knees, and bringing your body forward again as you transition back into the first phase."
Seated Cable Rows,strength,middle_back,cable,intermediate,"For this exercise you will need access to a low pulley row machine with a V-bar. Note: The V-bar will enable you to have a neutral grip where the palms of your hands face each other. To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked. Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles. With your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is the starting position of the exercise. Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Avoid swinging your torso back and forth as you can cause lower back injury by doing so. Variations: You can use a straight bar instead of a V-Bar and perform with a pronated grip (palms facing down-forward) or a supinated grip (palms facing up-reverse grip)."
Incline dumbbell row,strength,middle_back,dumbbell,intermediate,"Using a neutral grip, lean into an incline bench. Take a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip, beginning with the arms straight. This will be your starting position. Retract the shoulder blades and flex the elbows to row the dumbbells to your side. Pause at the top of the motion, and then return to the starting position."
Bent Over Two-Dumbbell Row With Palms In,strength,middle_back,dumbbell,beginner,"With a dumbbell in each hand (palms facing each other), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The weights should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position. While keeping the torso stationary, lift the dumbbells to your side as you breathe out, squeezing your shoulder blades together. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second. Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution:  This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues. Ensure perfect form and never round the back as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  Variations: You can perform the same exercise using a low pulley instead with a V-bar or with a barbell."
Upside-down pull-up,strength,middle_back,other,intermediate,"Begin by taking a medium to wide grip on a pull-up apparatus with your palms facing away from you. From a hanging position, tuck your knees to your chest, leaning back and getting your legs over your side of the pull-up apparatus. This will be your starting position. Beginning with your arms straight, flex the elbows and retract the shoulder blades to raise your body up until your legs contact the pull-up apparatus. After a brief pause, return to the starting position."
Bent Over Barbell Row,strength,middle_back,barbell,intermediate,"Holding a barbell with a pronated grip (palms facing down), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position. Now, while keeping the torso stationary, breathe out and lift the barbell to you. Keep the elbows close to the body and only use the forearms to hold the weight. At the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a brief pause. Then inhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues. Also, just like with the bent knee dead-lift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.

Single-arm cable seated row,strength,middle_back,cable,intermediate,"To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked. Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the single handle attachment with your left arm using a palms-down grip. With your arm extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lat as you hold the bar in front of you. The right arm can be kept by the waist. This is the starting position of the exercise. Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it as you rotate the wrist, so that by the time your hand is by your abdominals it is in a neutral position (palms facing the torso). Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in. Tip: Remember to rotate the wrist as you go back to the starting position so that the palms are facing down again. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform the same movement with the right hand.  Variations: You can perform this movement with a high pulley as well and standing up. You can also perform it doing a full rotation of the wrist. In other words, at the starting position you will have the palms of the hands facing down and at the end of the movement they will be facing up. Great movement to perform for a variety of purposes."
Kettlebell alternating renegade row,strength,middle_back,kettlebells,intermediate,"Place two kettlebells on the floor about shoulder width apart. Position yourself on your toes and your hands as though you were doing a pushup, with the body straight and extended. Use the handles of the kettlebells to support your upper body. You may need to position your feet wide for support.

Middle Back Shrug,strength,middle_back,dumbbell,beginner,"Lie facedown on an incline bench while holding a dumbbell in each hand. Your arms should be fully extended hanging down and pointing towards the floor. The palms of your hands should be facing each other. This will be your starting position. As you exhale, squeeze your shoulder blades together and hold the contraction for a full second. Tip: This movement is just like the reverse action of a hug, or trying to perform rear laterals as if you had no arms. As you inhale go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
Yates Row Reverse Grip,strength,middle_back,barbell,beginner,"Hold a barbell with a supinated grip a bit more than shoulder-width apart. Keep your feet hip-width apart and your knees slightly bent.

Mixed Grip Chin,strength,middle_back,body_only,intermediate,"Using a spacing that is just about 1 inch wider than shoulder width, grab a pull-up bar with the palms of one hand facing forward and the palms of the other hand facing towards you. This will be your starting position. Now start to pull yourself up as you exhale. Tip: With the arm that has the palms facing up concentrate on using the back muscles in order to perform the movement. The elbow of that arm should remain close to the torso. With the other arm that has the palms facing forward, the elbows will be away but in line with the torso. You will concentrate on using the lats to pull your body up. After a second contraction at the top, start to slowly come down as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. On the following set, switch grips; so if you had the right hand with the palms facing you and the left one with the palms facing forward, on the next set you will have the palms facing forward for the right hand and facing you for the left.  Variations:  If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight. Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help. On the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates."
Pendlay Row,strength,middle_back,barbell,intermediate,"Begin each repetition with the barbell dead on the ground. Take a medium pronated grip on the bar just in front of you. Your torso should be parallel to the ground with your lower back arched and knees partially bent. Begin with your shoulders protracted and your thoracic spine partially flexed. Your cervical spine should be neutral. This will be your starting position. Initiate the pull by extending your thoracic spine as you flex the elbow, attempting to pull the weight into your abdomen as quickly as possible. Focus on squeezing your shoulders back as you perform the movement retracting your shoulder blades. There should be no movement at the hips or knees and strict technique should be utilized. Return the weight to the ground between repetitions."

Then let it hang directly in front of you as your arms hang extended perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position. While keeping the torso stationary, lift the barbell as you breathe out, keeping the elbows close to the body and not doing any force with the forearm other than holding the weights. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second. Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution:  This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues. Also, just like with the bent knee deadlift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  Variations: You can perform the same exercise using a supinated (palms facing you) grip. You can also use barbells and dumbbells. Similar to the Barbell Bent Over Row but with a Smith Machine bar instead."

Lying T-Bar Row,strength,middle_back,other,intermediate,"Load up the T-bar Row Machine with the desired weight and adjust the leg height so that your upper chest is at the top of the pad. Tip: In some machines all you can do is stand on the appropriate step that allows you to be at a height that has the upper chest at the top of the pad. Lay face down on the pad and grab the handles. You can either use a palms down, palms up, or palms in position depending on what part of your back you want to emphasize. Lift the bar off the rack and extend your arms in front of you. This will be your starting position. As you exhale slowly pull the weight up and squeeze your back at the top of the movement. Tip: Keep the upper arms as close to the torso as possible throughout the movement in order to better engage the back muscles. Also, do not lift your body off of the pad at any time and refrain from using the biceps to lift the weight. After a second contraction at the top of the movement, as you inhale, slowly go back down to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
Leverage High Row,strength,middle_back,machine,beginner,"Load an appropriate weight onto the pins and adjust the seat height so that you can just reach the handles above you.

Let the arms hang to your sides fully extended as they point to the floor. Turn the wrists until your hands have a pronated (palms down) grip. Now flare the elbows out. This will be your starting position. As you breathe out, start to pull the dumbbells up as if you are doing a reverse bench press. You will do this by bending at the elbows and bringing the upper arms up as you let the forearms hang. Continue this motion until the upper arms are at the same level as your back. Tip: The elbows will come out to the side and your upper arms and torso should make the letter ""T"" at the top of the movement. Hold the contraction at the top for a second. Slowly go back down to the starting position as you breathe in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can perform this same movement but with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). You can also use a barbell."

Clean from Blocks,olympic_weightlifting,quadriceps,barbell,beginner,"With a barbell on boxes or stands of the desired height, take an overhand or hook grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position. Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight with the elbows pointed out. Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight. At the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.3.  As full extension is achieved, transition into the receiving position by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. Aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery. Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position. Return the weight to the boxes for the next rep."
Barbell Full Squat,strength,quadriceps,barbell,intermediate,"This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack just above shoulder level. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it. Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder-width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting back with your hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until your hamstrings are on your calves. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel or middle of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  This type of squat allows a greater range of motion, and allows the trunk to maintain a more vertical position than other types of squats, due to foot position and the higher bar position."
Tire flip,strongman,quadriceps,other,intermediate,"Begin by gripping the bottom of the tire on the tread, and position your feet back a bit. Your chest should be driving into the tire. To lift the tire, extend through the hips, knees, and ankles, driving into the tire and up. As the tire reaches a 45 degree angle, step forward and drive a knee into the tire. As you do so adjust your grip to the upper portion of the tire and push it forward as hard as possible to complete the turn. Repeat as necessary."
Barbell back squat to box,powerlifting,quadriceps,barbell,intermediate,"The box squat allows you to squat to desired depth and develop explosive strength in the squat movement. Begin in a power rack with a box at the appropriate height behind you. Typically, you would aim for a box height that brings you to a parallel squat, but you can train higher or lower if desired. Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward. With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box. Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe."
Push-press,olympic_weightlifting,quadriceps,barbell,intermediate,"Beginning Position:  Use the floor-to-shoulder lifting technique described in the Power Clean exercise to move the bar from the floor to the shoulders.  Upward Movement Phase:  Slightly flex the hips and knees, keeping torso erect. Immediately follow with an explosive push upward by extending the knees. Keep torso erect and tensed. At maximum hip and knee extension, shift body weight to balls of feet and extend ankle joints. At maximum plantar flexion, push bar from the shoulders. Push the bar with the arms to a fully extended elbow position overhead.  Downward Movement Phase:  Lower bar to shoulders. Flex hips and knees slightly as bar touches shoulders. Straighten the hips and knees before the upward movement phase begins again.  Breathing:  Exhale through the sticking point of the upward movement phase. Inhale during the downward movement phase."
Power snatch-,olympic_weightlifting,quadriceps,barbell,expert,"Place your feet at a shoulder width stance with the barbell resting right above the connection between the toes and the rest of the foot. With a palms facing down grip, bend at the knees and keeping the back flat grab the bar using a wider than shoulder width grip. Bring the hips down and make sure that your body drops as if you were going to sit on a chair. This will be your starting position. Start pushing the floor as if it were a moving platform with your feet and simultaneously start lifting the barbell keeping it close to your legs. As the bar reaches the middle of your thighs, push the floor with your legs and lift your body to a complete extension in an explosive motion. Lift your shoulders back in a shrugging movement as you bring the bar up while lifting your elbows out to the side and keeping them above the bar for as long as possible. Now in a very quick but powerful motion, you have to get your body under the barbell when it has reached a high enough point where it can be controlled and drop while locking your arms and holding the barbell overhead as you assume a squat position. Finalize the movement by rising up out of the squat position to finish the lift. At the end of the lift both feet should be on line and the arms fully extended holding the barbell overhead.  Caution: This is a very advanced exercise so be extremely careful with the weight used. Bad form on this exercise can lead to serious injury."
Hang Clean,olympic_weightlifting,quadriceps,barbell,beginner,"Begin with a shoulder width, double overhand or hook grip, with the bar hanging at the mid thigh position. Your back should be straight and inclined slightly forward. Begin by aggressively extending through the hips, knees and ankles, driving the weight upward. As you do so, shrug your shoulders towards your ears. As full extension is achieved, transition into the final pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.3.  Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position."
Reverse Band Box Squat,powerlifting,quadriceps,None,intermediate,"Begin in a power rack with a box at the appropriate height behind you. Set up the bands either on band pegs or attached to the top of the rack, ensuring they will be directly above the bar during the squat. Attach the other end to the bar. Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward. With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box. Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe.

Different speeds and techniques can be used to introduce variation. Rope jumping is exciting, challenges your coordination, and requires a lot of energy. A 150 lb person will burn about 350 calories jumping rope for 30 minutes, compared to over 450 calories running."
Barbell walking lunge,strength,quadriceps,barbell,intermediate,"Begin standing with your feet shoulder width apart and a barbell across your upper back. Step forward with one leg, flexing the knees to drop your hips. Descend until your rear knee nearly touches the ground. Your posture should remain upright, and your front knee should stay above the front foot. Drive through the heel of your lead foot and extend both knees to raise yourself back up. Step forward with your rear foot, repeating the lunge on the opposite leg."
Front Squats With Two Kettlebells,strength,quadriceps,kettlebells,beginner,"Clean two kettlebells to your shoulders. Clean the kettlebells to your shoulders by extending through the legs and hips as you pull the kettlebells towards your shoulders. Rotate your wrists as you do so. Looking straight ahead at all times, squat as low as you can and pause at the bottom. As you squat down, push your knees out. You should squat between your legs, keeping an upright torso, with your head and chest up. Rise back up by driving through your heels and repeat."
Single Leg Push-off,plyometrics,quadriceps,other,beginner,"Stand on the ground with one foot resting on the box, heel close to the edge. Push off with your foot on top of the box, trying to gain as much height as possible by extending through the hip and knee. Land with the same foot on top of the box, returning your other foot back to the start position."
Olympic Squat,olympic_weightlifting,quadriceps,barbell,beginner,"Begin with a barbell supported on top of the traps. The chest should be up, and the head facing forward. Adopt a hip width stance with the feet turned out as needed. Descend by flexing the knees, refraining from moving the hips back as much as possible. This requires that the knees travel forward; ensure that they stay aligned with the feet. The goal is to keep the torso as upright as possible. Continue all the way down, keeping the weight on the front of the heel. At the moment the upper legs contact the lower, reverse the motion, driving the weight upward."
Stair climber,cardio,quadriceps,machine,intermediate,"To begin, step onto the stepmill and select the desired option from the menu. You can choose a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Use caution so that you donâ€™t trip as you climb the stairs. It is recommended that you maintain your grip on the handles so that you donâ€™t fall. Stepmills offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than running outside while offering a similar rate of calories burned. They are typically much harder than other cardio equipment. A 150 lb person will typically burn over 300 calories in 30 minutes, compared to about 175 calories walking."
Kettlebell Pistol Squat,strength,quadriceps,kettlebells,beginner,"Pick up a kettlebell with two hands and hold it by the horns. Hold one leg off of the floor and squat down on the other. Squat down by flexing the knee and sitting back with the hips, holding the kettlebell up in front of you. Hold the bottom position for a second and then reverse the motion, driving through the heel and keeping your head and chest up. Lower yourself again and repeat."
Forward lunge,strength,quadriceps,body_only,intermediate,"Stand erect with your feet hip-width apart, chest out, and shoulders back, maintaining the natural curvature of your spine. Your knees should be unlocked and your hand on your hips. This is your starting position. Take a moderate-length step forward with one foot, descending to a point in which your rear knee approaches the floor without touching, maintaining your body's upright posture. Your front knee should bend about 90 degrees, but for knee health it should not be forward of the vertical plane that extends straight up from your toes. If so, take a slightly longer step. From the bottom position, push back up from your forward foot, bringing it back beside the other. Repeat on the opposite side for the required number of repetitions."
Narrow-stance squat,strength,quadriceps,barbell,expert,"This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it. Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart. Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section). Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. Variations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize. You can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance. Dumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides. The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used. I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats. (Note: For wide-stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently). Another way to perform these is by using a weight belt and attaching weights to it in between the legs. This variation is referred to as weight-belt squats which need to be performed with the legs placed on two well secured, raised, but separated platforms, that allow the weights to go up and down in the middle. This exercise is an excellent choice for people with lower back problems. The issue however is finding the platforms that meet the criteria. The only way I have been able to perform this is when I have two benches placed opposite to each other with spotting platforms that are facing each other. If you move the benches close enough then you get can execute the weight-belt squats by using the spotting platform. Finally, you can also perform squats in a Smith Machine though I do not recommend this. The reason for not performing regular squats on the Smith Machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise. While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap. So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward. For this reason, I highly recommend against Smith Machine use for squats. If you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used."
Bear crawl sled drag,strongman,quadriceps,other,intermediate,"Wearing either a harness or a loose weight belt, attach the chain to the back so that you will be facing away from the sled. Bend down so that your hands are on the ground. Your back should be flat and knees bent. This is your starting position. Begin by driving with legs, alternating left and right. Use your hands to maintain balance and to help pull. Try to keep your back flat as you move over a given distance."
Box Squat with Bands,powerlifting,quadriceps,barbell,beginner,"Begin in a power rack with a box at the appropriate height behind you. Set up the bands on the sleeves, secured to either band pegs, the rack, or dumbbells so that there is appropriate tension. If dumbbells are used, secure them so that they don't move. Also, ensure that the dumbbells you are using are heavy enough for the bands that you are using. Additional plates can be used to hold the dumbbells down. If more tension is needed, you can either widen the base on the floor or choke the bands. Typically, you would aim for a box height that brings you to a parallel squat, but you can train higher or lower if desired. Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward. With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box. Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe. Use care to return the barbell to the rack."
Single-leg depth squat,strength,quadriceps,bands,intermediate,"Position a box in a rack. Secure a band or rope in place above the box. Standing in front of it, step onto the box to a full standing position, letting your other leg remain unsupported. Hold onto the band for balance . Continue stepping up and down on the same leg before switching to the opposite side."
Weighted Jump Squat,strength,quadriceps,barbell,beginner,"Position a lightly loaded barbell across the back of your shoulders. You could also use a weighted vest, sandbag, or other type of resistance for this exercise. The weight should be light enough that it doesn't slow you down significantly. Your feet should be just outside of shoulder width with your head and chest up. This will be your starting position. Using a countermovement, squat partially down and immediately reverse your direction to explode off of the ground, extending through your hips, knees, and ankles. Maintain good posture throughout the jump. As you return to the ground, absorb the impact through your legs."
Squat with Chains,powerlifting,quadriceps,barbell,beginner,"To set up the chains, begin by looping the leader chain over the sleeves of the bar. The heavy chain should be attached using a snap hook. Adjust the length of the lead chain so that a few links are still on the floor at the top of the movement. Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wide for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings. Keep your head facing forward. With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips as much as possible. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Lower bar position necessitates a greater torso lean to keep the bar over the heels. Continue until you break parallel, which is defined as the crease of the hip being in line with the top of the knee. Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe, until you have returned to the starting position."
Bicycling,cardio,quadriceps,other,intermediate,"To begin, seat yourself on the bike and adjust the seat to your height. Wear protective gear to avoid possible injury. Ensure that you are courteous to vehicles and pedestrians, and that you obey the rules of the road.  Cycling offers convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and has less impact than other activities. A 150 lb person will burn about 280 calories cycling at a moderate rate for 30 minutes, compared to 450 calories or more running."
Barbell Squat,strength,quadriceps,barbell,intermediate,"Begin with the barbell supported on top of the traps. The chest should be up and the head facing forward. Adopt a hip-width stance with the feet turned out as needed. Descend by flexing the knees, refraining from moving the hips back as much as possible. This requires that the knees travel forward. Ensure that they stay align with the feet. The goal is to keep the torso as upright as possible. Continue all the way down, keeping the weight on the front of the heel. At the moment the upper legs contact the lower legs reverse the motion, driving the weight upward."
Dumbbell Goblet Squat,strength,quadriceps,dumbbell,intermediate,"From a standing position cradle the head of a dumbbell close to your chest with both hands. You should be looking straight forward, with your shoulders back, your spine straight, and your feet just outside of shoulder width. This will be your starting position. Initiate the movement by descending into a squat, flexing the hips and knees to lower your body. Maintain the angle of your torso, paying close attention to the preservation of your spine. As you descend, push your knees outward and keep your weight on your heels. Descend until you either reach the full squat position with your hamstrings on your calves or until your back starts to round. At the bottom of the motion pause briefly. Return to the starting position by driving through your heels, extending the knees and hips to return to the starting position. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions."
Dumbbell squat,strength,quadriceps,dumbbell,intermediate,"Stand up straight while holding a dumbbell on each hand (palms facing the side of your legs). Position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section. Begin to slowly lower your torso by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly. Begin to raise your torso as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. You may use wrist wraps for this exercise. Variations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize. You can also use a barbell for this exercise."
Barbell front squat,strength,quadriceps,barbell,intermediate,"This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control. Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).

Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the middle of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The front squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. This version of the squat is better suited for advanced athletes. Variations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize. You can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance."
Side-to-side box skip,plyometrics,quadriceps,body_only,intermediate,"Stand to one side of the box with your left foot resting on the middle of it. To begin, jump up and over to the other side of the box, landing with your right foot on top of the box and your left foot on the floor. Swing your arms to aid your movement. Continue shuffling back and forth across the box."
Leg Press,strength,quadriceps,machine,intermediate,"Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section). Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you. Tip: Make sure that you do not lock your knees. Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position. As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle. Pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and ensure to lock the safety pins properly once you are done. You do not want that platform falling on you fully loaded.  Caution: Always check to make sure that when you re-rack the weight the platform is securely locked. Variations: All foot stance variations described in the foot stance section."
Barbell forward lunge,strength,quadriceps,barbell,expert,"This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack just below shoulder level. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it. Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and step forward with your right leg and squat down through your hips, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Note: Do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. li> Using mainly the heel of your foot, push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale. Repeat the movement for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.  Caution: This is a movement that requires a great deal of balance so if you suffer from balance problems you may wish to either avoid it or just use your own bodyweight while holding on to a fixed object. Definitely never perform with a barbell on your back if you suffer from balance issues. Variations: There are several ways to perform the exercise.  One way is to alternate each leg. For instance do one repetition with the right, then the left, then the right and so on. The other way is to do what I call a static lunge where your starting position is with one of your feet already forward. In this case, you just go up and down from that starting position until you are done with the recommended amount of repetitions. Then you switch legs and do the same. A more challenging version is the walking lunges where you walk across the room but in a lunging fashion. For walking lunges the leg being left back has to be brought forward after the lunging action has happened in order to continue moving ahead. This version is reserved for the most advanced athletes."
Dumbbell Lunges,strength,quadriceps,dumbbell,intermediate,"Stand with your torso upright holding two dumbbells in your hands by your sides. This will be your starting position.

Elliptical trainer,cardio,quadriceps,machine,intermediate,"To begin, step onto the elliptical and select the desired option from the menu. Most ellipticals have a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Elevation can be adjusted to change the intensity of the workout. The handles can be used to monitor your heart rate to help you stay at an appropriate intensity.  Ellipticals offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and have far less impact on joints than ground-based cardio such as running. A 150 lb person will burn on average 387 calories in 30 minutes, compared to more than 450-700 calories running. Itâ€™s recommended that you use the arms on the elliptical to create more movement, if your elliptical has them."
Bodyweight squat,strength,quadriceps,body_only,intermediate,"Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. You can place your hands behind your head. This will be your starting position.

Narrow Stance Hack Squats,strength,quadriceps,machine,beginner,Place the back of your torso against the back pad of the machine and hook your shoulders under the shoulder pads provided. Position your legs in the platform using a less than shoulder width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Your feet should be around 3 inches or less apart. Tip: Keep your head up at all times and also maintain the back on the pad at all times. Place your arms on the side handles of the machine and disengage the safety bars (which on most designs is done by moving the side handles from a facing front position to a diagonal position). Now straighten your legs without locking the knees. This will be your starting position. Begin to slowly lower the unit by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up (back on the pad at all times). Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Begin to raise the unit as you exhale by pushing the floor with mainly with the heels of your feet as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.

Pump your legs up and down in an established rhythm, driving the pedals down but not all the way to the floor. It is recommended that you maintain your grip on the handles so that you donâ€™t fall. The handles can be used to monitor your heart rate to help you stay at an appropriate intensity. Stairmasters offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than running outside. They are typically much harder than other cardio equipment. A 150 lb person will typically burn over 300 calories in 30 minutes, compared to about 175 calories walking."
Double Leg Butt Kick,plyometrics,quadriceps,None,intermediate,"Begin standing with your knees slightly bent. Quickly squat a short distance, flexing the hips and knees, and immediately extend to jump for maximum vertical height. As you go up, tuck your heels by flexing the knees, attempting to touch the buttocks. Finish the motion by landing with the knees only partially bent, using your legs to absorb the impact."
Broad jump,plyometrics,quadriceps,body_only,intermediate,"This drill is best done in sand or other soft landing surface. Ensure that you are able to measure distance. Stand in a partial squat stance with feet shoulder width apart. Utilizing a big arm swing and a countermovement of the legs, jump forward as far as you can. Attempt to land with your feet out in front you, reaching as far as possible with your legs. Measure the distance from your landing point to the starting point and track results."
Machine Squat,strength,quadriceps,machine,intermediate,"Adjust the weight to an appropriate load for your training. With a shoulder-width stance, squat under the shoulder pads and adjust the machine to the appropriate height.

Finish the movement by jumping in the air and bringing your hands over your head. Repeat."
Dumbbell reverse lunge,strength,quadriceps,dumbbell,intermediate,"Stand with your torso upright holding two dumbbells in your hands by your sides. This will be your starting position. Step backward with your right leg around two feet or so from the left foot and lower your upper body down, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Tip: As in the other exercises, do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. Make sure that you keep your front shin perpendicular to the ground. Keep the torso upright during the lunge; flexible hip flexors are important. A long lunge emphasizes the Gluteus Maximus; a short lunge emphasizes Quadriceps. Push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale. Tip: Use the ball of your feet to push in order to accentuate the quadriceps. To focus on the glutes, press with your heels. Now repeat with the opposite leg.  Variations: There are several ways to perform the exercise. You can do what I call a static lunge where your starting position is with one of your feet already forward. In this case, you just go up and down from that starting position until you are done with the recommended amount of repetitions. Then you switch legs and do the same. A more challenging version is the walking lunges where you walk across the room but in a lunging fashion. For walking lunges the leg being left back has to be brought forward after the lunging action has happened in order to continue moving ahead. This version is reserved for the most advanced athletes. Lunges can be performed with dumbbells as described above or with a barbell on the back, though the barbell variety is better suited for the advanced athletes who have mastered the exercise and no longer have balance issues."
Barbell step-up,strength,quadriceps,barbell,intermediate,"Stand up straight while holding a barbell placed on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) and stand upright behind an elevated platform (such as the one used for spotting behind a flat bench). This is your starting position. Place the right foot on the elevated platform. Step on the platform by extending the hip and the knee of your right leg. Use the heel mainly to lift the rest of your body up and place the foot of the left leg on the platform as well. Breathe out as you execute the force required to come up. Step down with the left leg by flexing the hip and knee of the right leg as you inhale. Return to the original standing position by placing the right foot of to next to the left foot on the initial position. Repeat with the right leg for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.  Note: This is a great exercise for people with lower back problems that are unable to do stiff legged deadlifts. Variations: Just like lunges, this exercise can also be performed by alternating between the right and the left leg every time until all repetitions have been performed for both legs. Also, dumbbells can be used. Beginners can start with only the bodyweight, especially if they have balance issues."
Smith machine back squat,strength,quadriceps,machine,intermediate,"To begin, first set the bar on the height that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it. Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side (palms facing forward), unlock it and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section). Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with leg presses instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. Variations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize. You can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance. Same as the Barbell Squat but with a Smith Machine."
Trail Running/Walking,cardio,quadriceps,body_only,intermediate,"Running or hiking on trails will get the blood pumping and heart beating almost immediately. Make sure you have good shoes. While you use the muscles in your calves and buttocks to pull yourself up a hill, the knees, joints and ankles absorb the bulk of the pounding coming back down. Take smaller steps as you walk downhill, keep your knees bent to reduce the impact and slow down to avoid falling. A 150 lb person can burn over 200 calories for 30 minutes walking uphill, compared to 175 on a flat surface. If running the trail, a 150 lb person can burn well over 500 calories in 30 minutes."

Goblet Squat,strength,quadriceps,kettlebells,intermediate,"Stand holding a light kettlebell by the horns close to your chest. This will be your starting position. Squat down between your legs until your hamstrings are on your calves. Keep your chest and head up and your back straight. At the bottom position, pause and use your elbows to push your knees out. Return to the starting position, and repeat for 10-20 repetitions."
Split Squat with Dumbbells,strength,quadriceps,dumbbell,intermediate,"Position yourself into a staggered stance with the rear foot elevated and front foot forward. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, letting them hang at the sides. This will be your starting position. Begin by descending, flexing your knee and hip to lower your body down. Maintain good posture througout the movement. Keep the front knee in line with the foot as you perform the exercise. At the bottom of the movement, drive through the heel to extend the knee and hip to return to the starting position."
Leg Extensions,strength,quadriceps,machine,intermediate,"For this exercise you will need to use a leg extension machine. First choose your weight and sit on the machine with your legs under the pad (feet pointed forward) and the hands holding the side bars. This will be your starting position. Tip: You will need to adjust the pad so that it falls on top of your lower leg (just above your feet). Also, make sure that your legs form a 90-degree angle between the lower and upper leg. If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint. If the machine is designed that way, either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle. Using your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale. Ensure that the rest of the body remains stationary on the seat. Pause a second on the contracted position. Slowly lower the weight back to the original position as you inhale, ensuring that you do not go past the 90-degree angle limit. Repeat for the recommended amount of times.  Variations: As mentioned at in the foot positioning section, you can use various foot positions in order to maximize stimulation of certain thigh areas. Also, you can perform the movement unilaterally (one leg at a time)."
Barbell Bulgarian split squat,strength,quadriceps,barbell,intermediate,"Start by standing about 2 to 3 feet in front of a flat bench with your back facing the bench. Have a barbell in front of you on the floor. Tip: Your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. Bend the knees and use a pronated grip with your hands being wider than shoulder width apart from each other to lift the barbell up until you can rest it on your chest. Then lift the barbell over your head and rest it on the base of your neck. Move one foot back so that your toe is resting on the flat bench. Your other foot should be stationary in front of you. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. Tip: Make sure your back is straight and chest is out while performing this exercise. As you inhale, slowly lower your leg until your thigh is parallel to the floor. At this point, your knee should be over your toes. Your chest should be directly above the middle of your thigh. Leading with the chest and hips and contracting the quadriceps, elevate your leg back to the starting position as you exhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Switch legs and repeat the movement.  Variations: You can use a step up box to place your toes on to perform this exercise. You can even elevate the step up box. Note: the higher the step up box, the more difficult it is to perform this exercise. Caution: Keeping your balance with this exercise can be challenging. This is an advanced exercise and should not be performed unless you are an experienced weight lifter."
Scissors Jump,plyometrics,quadriceps,body_only,expert,"Assume a lunge stance position with one foot forward with the knee bent, and the rear knee nearly touching the ground. Ensure that the front knee is over the midline of the foot. Extending through both legs, jump as high as possible, swinging your arms to gain lift. As you jump as high as you can, switch the position of your legs, moving your front leg to the back and the rear leg to the front. As you land, absorb the impact through the legs by adopting the lunge position, and repeat."
Hang Clean - Below the Knees,olympic_weightlifting,quadriceps,barbell,beginner,"Begin with a shoulder width, double overhand or hook grip, with the bar hanging just below the knees. Your back should be straight and inclined slightly forward. Begin by aggressively extending through the hips, knees and ankles, driving the weight upward. As you do so, shrug your shoulders towards your ears. As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery. Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position."
Jumping jack-,plyometrics,quadriceps,body_only,intermediate,"Start by standing with your feet together. In one motion, jump your feet out to the side and raise your arms above your head. Immediately reverse the motion by jumping back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
Barbell hack squat,strength,quadriceps,barbell,expert,"Stand up straight while holding a barbell behind you at arms length and your feet at shoulder width. Tip: A shoulder width grip is best with the palms of your hands facing back. You can use wrist wraps for this exercise for a better grip. This will be your starting position. While keeping your head and eyes up and back straight, squat until your upper thighs are parallel to the floor. Breathe in as you slowly go down. Pressing mainly with the heel of the foot and squeezing the thighs, go back up as you breathe out. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: This exercise can also be performed with your heels slightly elevated on a small block. This is a good option for beginners who lack the flexibility to perform the exercise without it."
Hack Squat,strength,quadriceps,barbell,intermediate,"Place the back of your torso against the back pad of the machine and hook your shoulders under the shoulder pads provided. Position your legs in the platform using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Tip: Keep your head up at all times and also maintain the back on the pad at all times. Place your arms on the side handles of the machine and disengage the safety bars (which on most designs is done by moving the side handles from a facing front position to a diagonal position). Now straighten your legs without locking the knees. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section). Begin to slowly lower the unit by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up (back on the pad at all times). Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly. Begin to raise the unit as you exhale by pushing the floor with mainly with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: All foot variations discussed in the foot positioning section apply."
Arms-crossed jump squat,strength,quadriceps,body_only,intermediate,"Cross your arms over your chest. With your head up and your back straight, position your feet at shoulder width. Keeping your back straight and chest up, squat down as you inhale until your upper thighs are parallel, or lower, to the floor. Now pressing mainly with the ball of your feet, jump straight up in the air as high as possible, using the thighs like springs. Exhale during this portion of the movement. When you touch the floor again, immediately squat down and jump again. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Do not perform this movement if you have any knee or back injuries due to the impact involved. Also, make certain that your landings are controlled and that you land with your two feet straight (toes touching the floor first). The wrong landing can result in a sprained ligament. Variations: You can also perform this movement with a barbell resting on your shoulders or while holding dumbbells by your sides."
Skating,cardio,quadriceps,other,beginner,"Roller skating is a fun activity which can be effective in improving cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular endurance. It requires relatively good balance and coordination. It is necessary to learn the basics of skating including turning and stopping and to wear protective gear to avoid possible injury. You can skate at a comfortable pace for 30 minutes straight. If you want a cardio challenge, do interval skating â€“ speed skate two minutes of every five minutes, using the remaining three minutes to recover. A 150 lb person will typically burn about 175 calories in 30 minutes skating at a comfortable pace, similar to brisk walking."
Treadmill running,cardio,quadriceps,machine,intermediate,"To begin, step onto the treadmill and select the desired option from the menu. Most treadmills have a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Elevation can be adjusted to change the intensity of the workout. Treadmills offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than running outside. A 150 lb person will burn over 450 calories running 8 miles per hour for 30 minutes. Maintain proper posture as you run, and only hold onto the handles when necessary, such as when dismounting or checking your heart rate."
Smith machine shrug,strength,traps,machine,intermediate,"To begin, set the bar height on the smith machine around the middle of your thighs. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, grab the bar using a pronated grip (palms facing you) shoulder width apart from each other. Lift the barbell up and fully extend your arms with your back straight. This is the starting position. While exhaling, elevate the bar by raising your shoulders until they come close to touching your ears. Hold the contraction for a second before lowering the bar back down to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  This exercise can be performed using a squat rack with a barbell. However, be careful not to select a weight that is so heavy that it causes you to break good form as you do not have the support of the smith machine for this variation. Too much weight can harm your back. You can also use dumbbells to perform this exercise."
Leverage Shrug,strength,traps,machine,intermediate,"Load the pins to an appropriate weight. Position yourself directly between the handles.

Standing dumbbell upright row,strength,traps,dumbbell,intermediate,"Grasp a dumbbell in each hand with a pronated (palms forward) grip that is slightly less than shoulder width. The dumbbells should be resting on top of your thighs. Your arms should be extended with a slight bend at the elbows and your back should be straight. This will be your starting position. Use your side shoulders to lift the dumbbells as you exhale. The dumbbells should be close to the body as you move it up and the elbows should drive the motion. Continue to lift them until they nearly touch your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the dumbbells, your elbows should always be higher than your forearms. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement. Lower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from upright rows and substitute by some form of lateral raises. Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a straight bar attached to a low pulley and it can also be performed using an e-z bar."

Cable V-bar push-down,strength,triceps,cable,intermediate,"Attach a V-Bar to a high pulley and grab with an overhand grip (palms facing down) at shoulder width. Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the bar. The thumbs should be higher than the small finger. This is your starting position. Using the triceps, bring the bar down until it touches the front of your thighs and the arms are fully extended perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement. After a second hold at the contracted position, bring the V-Bar slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: There are many variations to this movement. For instance you can use an E-Z bar attachment as well as a straight cable bar attachment for different variations of the exercise. Also, you can attach a rope to the pulley as well as using a reverse grip on the bar exercises. Just like the Triceps Pushdown but with the V-Bar attachment."
Weighted bench dip,strength,triceps,body_only,intermediate,"For this exercise you will need to place a bench behind your back and another one in front of you. With the benches perpendicular to your body, hold on to one bench on its edge with the hands close to your body, separated at shoulder width. Your arms should be fully extended. The legs will be extended forward on top of the other bench. Your legs should be parallel to the floor while your torso is to be perpendicular to the floor. Have your partner place the dumbbell on your lap. Note: This exercise is best performed with a partner as placing the weight on your lap can be challenging and cause injury without assistance. This will be your starting position. Slowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement. Forearms should always be pointing down. Using your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position while exhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: By placing your legs on top of another flat bench in front of you, the exercise becomes more challenging. It is best to attempt this exercise without any weights at first in order to get used to the movements required for good form. If that variation also becomes easy, then you can have a partner place plates on top of your lap. Make sure that in this case the partner ensures that the weights stay there throughout the movement."
EZ-Bar Skullcrusher,strength,triceps,e-z_curl_bar,intermediate,"Using a close grip, lift the EZ bar and hold it with your elbows in as you lie on the bench.

Reverse Grip Triceps Pushdown,strength,triceps,cable,intermediate,"Start by setting a bar attachment (straight or e-z) on a high pulley machine. Facing the bar attachment, grab it with the palms facing up (supinated grip) at shoulder width. Lower the bar by using your lats until your arms are fully extended by your sides. Tip: Elbows should be in by your sides and your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position. Slowly elevate the bar attachment up as you inhale so it is aligned with your chest. Only the forearms should move and the elbows/upper arms should be stationary by your side at all times. Then begin to lower the cable bar back down to the original staring position while exhaling and contracting the triceps hard. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variation: This exercise can also be performed with a single handle using one arm at a time. This will allow you to better isolate the triceps. With this version you can self spot yourself by placing your hand over your forearm and applying some pressure to help you perform more reps than before."
Push-Ups - Close Triceps Position,strength,triceps,body_only,intermediate,"Lie on the floor face down and place your hands closer than shoulder width for a close hand position. Make sure that you are holding your torso up at arms' length. Lower yourself until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale. Using your triceps and some of your pectoral muscles, press your upper body back up to the starting position and squeeze your chest. Breathe out as you perform this step. After a second pause at the contracted position, repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations:  If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, you can either bend your legs at the knees to take off resistance or perform the exercise against the wall instead of the floor. For the most advanced lifters, you can place your feet at a high surface such as a bench in order to increase the resistance.  See Also: Push-Up"
Kneeling cable triceps extension,strength,triceps,cable,intermediate,"Place a bench sideways in front of a high pulley machine.

Single-arm cable triceps extension,strength,triceps,cable,intermediate,"With your right hand, grasp a single handle attached to the high-cable pulley using a supinated (underhand; palms facing up) grip. You should be standing directly in front of the weight stack. Now pull the handle down so that your upper arm and elbow are locked in to the side of your body. Your upper arm and forearm should form an acute angle (less than 90-degrees). You can keep the other arm by the waist and you can have one leg in front of you and the other one back for better balance. This will be your starting position. As you contract the triceps, move the single handle attachment down to your side until your arm is straight. Breathe out as you perform this movement. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Your upper arms should remain stationary at all times. Squeeze the triceps and hold for a second in this contracted position. Slowly return the handle to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform the same movement with the other arm.  Variations: You can use exercise bands to perform this exercise."
Triceps Pushdown - Rope Attachment,strength,triceps,None,intermediate,"Attach a rope attachment to a high pulley and grab with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the rope with the palms facing each other. This is your starting position. Using the triceps, bring the rope down as you bring each side of the rope to the side of your thighs. At the end of the movement the arms are fully extended and perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement. After holding for a second, at the contracted position, bring the rope slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: There are many variations to this movement. For instance you can use an E-Z bar attachment as well as a V-angled bar or straight bar. Same as the Triceps Pushdown except with the rope attachment."
Seated triceps press,strength,triceps,dumbbell,intermediate,"Sit down on a bench with back support and grasp a dumbbell with both hands and hold it overhead at arm's length. Tip: a better way is to have somebody hand it to you especially if it is very heavy. The resistance should be resting in the palms of your hands with your thumbs around it. The palm of the hand should be facing inward. This will be your starting position. Keeping your upper arms close to your head (elbows in) and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semi-circular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step. Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  You can perform this exercise standing as well but this puts strain on your back especially if you are using heavy dumbbells like 95 lbs or so. Another variation is to use an EZ or straight bar instead in which case you will be holding the bar from the inside (around 5 inches between both hands) with the palms facing forward (pronated grip). There is also a bar that has parallel bars inside (often referred to as a triceps blaster) and this can also be used for this exercise. Finally, a low pulley cable with a rope attachment or bar (straight or EZ) attachment at the end can be used for variety purposes as well."

As you breathe in, slowly lower the weight until the bar lightly touches your forehead while keeping the upper arms and elbows stationary. At that point, use the triceps to bring the weight back up to the starting position as you breathe out. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: This is an exercise that you need to be very careful with when selecting the weight. Also, if you suffer from elbow problems this exercise might be too harsh on your elbows, so you may need to look for a substitute. Variations:  There are a few variations of this exercise. You can perform it on a decline bench as opposed to a flat bench. You can also perform it using dumbbells in which case the palms of the hands will be facing each other as opposed to facing forward. Also, you can try to do it using a revere grip (palms facing you) but this variation seems to strain my wrists."
Lying Close-Grip Barbell Triceps Press To Chin,strength,triceps,e-z_curl_bar,beginner,"While holding a barbell or EZ Curl bar with a pronated grip (palms facing forward), lie on your back on a flat bench with your head off the end of the bench. Tip: If you are holding a barbell grab it using a shoulder-width grip and if you are using an E-Z Bar grab it on the inner handles. Extend your arms in front of you as you hold the barbell over your chest. The arms should be perpendicular to your torso (90-degree angle). This will be your starting position. As you inhale, lower the bar in a semi-circular motion by bending at the elbows and while keeping the upper arm stationary and elbows in. Keep lowering the bar until it lightly touches your chin. As you exhale bring the bar back up to the starting position by pushing the bar up in a semi-circular motion. Contract the triceps hard at the top of the movement for a second. Tip: Again, only the forearms should move. The upper arms should remain stationary at all times. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variation: You can use dumbbells to make the exercise more challenging."
Tate Press,strength,triceps,dumbbell,beginner,"Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other. By using your thighs to help you get the dumbbells up, clean the dumbbells one arm at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width. Note: when holding the dumbbells in front of you, make sure your arms are wider than shoulder width apart from each other using a pronated (palms forward) grip. Allow your elbows to point out. This is your starting position. Keeping the upper arms stationary, slowly move the dumbbells in and down in a semi circular motion until they touch the upper chest while inhaling. Keep full control of the dumbbells at all times and do not move the upper arms nor rest the dumbbells on the chest. As you breathe out, move the dumbbells up using your triceps and the same semi-circular motion but in reverse. Attempt to keep the dumbbells together as they move up. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down again slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.  Caution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you. Just lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you can place the dumbbells on the floor."
Single-arm low cable triceps extension,strength,triceps,cable,intermediate,"Grab a single handle with your left arm next to the low pulley machine. Turn away from the machine keeping the handle to the side of your body with your arm fully extended. Now use both hands to elevate the single handle directly above the head with the palm facing forward. Keep your upper arm completely vertical (perpendicular to the floor) and put your right hand on your left elbow to help keep it steady. This is the starting position. Keeping your upper arms close to your head (elbows in) and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step. Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the single handle. Breathe out as you perform this step. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Switch arms and repeat the exercise.  Variation: Another way to perform this exercise is to use the end of a rope attachment."
Standing Bent-Over One-Arm Dumbbell Triceps Extension,strength,triceps,dumbbell,intermediate,"With a dumbbell in one hand and the palm facing your torso, bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Make sure that you keep the head up. The upper arm should be close to the torso and parallel to the floor while the forearm is pointing towards the floor as the hand holds the weight. Tip: There should be a 90-degree angle between the forearm and the upper arm. This is your starting position. Keeping the upper arms stationary, use the triceps to lift the weights as you exhale until the forearms are parallel to the floor and the whole arm is extended. Like many other arm exercises, only the forearm moves. After a second contraction at the top, slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. Switch arms and repeat the exercise."
Seated Bent-Over One-Arm Dumbbell Triceps Extension,strength,triceps,dumbbell,beginner,"Sit down at the end of a flat bench with a dumbbell in one arm using a neutral grip (palms of the hand facing you). Bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Make sure that you keep the head up. The upper arm with the dumbbell should be close to the torso and aligned with it (lifted up until it is parallel to the floor while the forearms are pointing towards the floor as the hands hold the weights). Tip: There should be a 90-degree angle between the forearms and the upper arm. This is your starting position. Keeping the upper arm stationary, use the triceps to lift the weight as you exhale until the forearm is parallel to the floor and the whole arm is extended. Like many other arm exercises, only the forearm moves. After a second contraction at the top, slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. Switch arms and repeat the exercise.  Variations:  This exercise can be executed also with two arms at a time. Also, if you like the one arm variety, you can use a low pulley handle instead of a dumbbell for better peak contraction. In this case, the palms should be facing up (supinated grip) as opposed to the torso (neutral grip). You can also use a rope attachment however, and in this manner, you can also perform the movement with a neutral grip."
Machine Triceps Extension,strength,triceps,machine,intermediate,"Adjust the seat to the appropriate height and make your weight selection. Place your upper arms against the pads and grasp the handles. This will be your starting position. Perform the movement by extending the elbow, pulling your lower arm away from your upper arm. Pause at the completion of the movement, and then slowly return the weight to the starting position. Avoid returning the weight all the way to the stops until the set is complete to keep tension on the muscles being worked."
One Arm Floor Press,strength,triceps,barbell,beginner,"Lie down on a flat surface with your back pressing against the floor or an exercise mat. Make sure your knees are bent. Have a partner hand you the bar on one hand. When starting, your arm should be just about fully extended, similar to the starting position of a barbell bench press. However, this time your grip will be neutral (palms facing your torso). Make sure the hand you are not using to lift the weight is placed by your side. Begin the exercise by lowering the barbell until your elbow touches the ground. Make sure to breathe in as this is the eccentric (lowering part of the exercise). Then start lifting the barbell back up to the original starting position. Remember to breathe out during the concentric (lifting part of the exercise). Repeat until you have performed your recommended repetitions. Switch arms and repeat the movement.  Variations: You can also perform this exercise using dumbbells. By using dumbbells you will be able to isolate your chest and add some variety to your workouts. Caution: When you are done, do not drop the barbell or dumbbell next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you. A better way to do this is to use both of your hands to grab the barbell or dumbbell and place it to your side. Simply move the barbell or dumbbell away from the arm you are exercising before dropping the weights. This will ensure optimal safety and prevent any injuries."
Incline cable straight-bar triceps extension,strength,triceps,cable,intermediate,"Lie on incline an bench facing away from a high pulley machine that has a straight bar attachment on it. Grasp the straight bar attachment overhead with a pronated (overhand; palms down) narrow grip (less than shoulder width) and keep your elbows tucked in to your sides. Your upper arms should create around a 25 degree angle when measured from the floor. Keeping the upper arms stationary, extend the arms as you flex the triceps. Breathe out during this portion of the movement and hold the contraction for a second. Slowly go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can also use an angled attachment or a rope attachment as well. Finally, you can perform one arm at a time by using a single handle attachment."
Pin Presses,powerlifting,triceps,barbell,beginner,"Pin presses remove the eccentric phase of the bench press, developing starting strength. They also allow you to train a desired range of motion. The bench should be set up in a power rack. Set the pins to the desired point in your range of motion, whether it just be lockout or an inch off of your chest. The bar should be moved to the pins and prepared for lifting. Begin by lying on the bench, with the bar directly above the contact point during your regular bench. Tuck your feet underneath you and arch your back. Using the bar to help support your weight, lift your shoulder off the bench and retract them, squeezing the shoulder blades together. Use your feet to drive your traps into the bench. Maintain this tight body position throughout the movement. You can take a standard bench grip, or shoulder width to focus on the triceps. The bar, wrist, and elbow should stay in line at all times. Focus on squeezing the bar and trying to pull it apart. Drive the bar up with as much force as possible. The elbows should be tucked in until lockout. Return the bar to the pins, pausing before beginning the next repetition."
Standing Towel Triceps Extension,strength,triceps,body_only,beginner,"To begin, stand up with both arms fully extended above the head holding one end of a towel with both hands. Your elbows should be in and the arms perpendicular to the floor with the palms facing each other while your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position. Now communicate with your partner so that he/she can grip the other side of the towel to apply resistance. Keeping your upper arms close to your head (elbows in) and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step. Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the towel. Breathe out as you perform this step. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Make sure your partner does not apply to much resistance or suddenly jerks the towel as doing so could cause injury. Start out by having your partner applying barely any resistance so you can get used to the exercise. As you practice the exercise, then your partner can gradually begin to increase the resistance of the exercise. Variation: You can perform this exercise with one arm at a time or even sitting down for more back support."
Dumbbell Tricep Extension -Pronated Grip,strength,triceps,dumbbell,beginner,"Lie down on a flat bench holding two dumbbells directly above your shoulders. Your arms should be fully extended and form a 90 degree angle from your torso and the floor. The palms of your hands should be facing forward, and your elbows should be tucked in. This will be your starting position. Now, inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells until they are near your ears. Be sure to keep your upper arms stationary and your elbows tucked in. Then, exhale and use your triceps to return the weight to the starting position."
Tricep Side Stretch,stretching,triceps,body_only,intermediate,"Bring right arm across your body and over your left shoulder, holding your elbow with your left hand, until you feel a stretch in your tricep. Then repeat for your other arm."
Triceps Stretch,stretching,triceps,body_only,intermediate,"Reach your hand behind your head, grasp your elbow and gently pull. Hold for 10 to 20 seconds, then switch sides."
Overhead Triceps,stretching,triceps,body_only,beginner,"Sit upright on the floor with your partner behind you. Raise one arm straight up, and flex the elbow, attempting to touch your hand to your back. Your parner should hold your elbow and wrist. This will be your starting position. Attempt to extend the arm straight into the air as your partner prevents you from doing actually doing so. After 10-20 seconds, relax the arm and allow your partner to further stretch the tricep by applying gentle pressure to the wrist. Hold for 10-20 seconds, and then switch sides."
JM Press With Bands,strength,triceps,barbell,beginner,"Load the bar to an appropriate weight for your training. Attach short bands to the bar, anchoring them to heavy dumbbells that cannot move. Lay on the bench with your feet flat on the ground, driving through with your hips. Your back should be arched and your shoulder blades retracted. Take a medium pronated grip, covering the rings on the bar. Remove the bar from the rack, holding the weight above your clavicle with your arms extended. This will be your starting position. Lower the bar by displacing your elbows forward. The bar should only move vertically, making the exercise resemble a hybrid bench press and skull-crusher. Lower the weight but stop short of allowing it to touch your chest, then return the bar to the starting position."
